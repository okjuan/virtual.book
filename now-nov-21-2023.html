    <div class="paragraph"><p>I‚Äôve been losing weight, playing soccer, developing this site, reading books, and more.

<h3 id="life">Life</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Preparing green card papers for my wife, Z.
We probably won‚Äôt get them until early 2025.
<em>Sigh</em>.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Enjoying the fall.
Except for the short days.
Sun sets at 4:30pm nowadays.
Blehj.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Playing soccer.
I‚Äôve noticed in the last several months that I‚Äôm scoring more goals from longer range, 20+ yards away from goal.
I‚Äôm delighted that it‚Äôs turning out to be one of my strengths in the game.
I‚Äôd gotten used to thinking that headers and penalties were my only goal-scoring strengths.
(And, actually, I‚Äôve gotten worse at penalties in the last several years.)
I think I‚Äôm reaping the benefits of the hours I spent in my late teens (and perhaps early twenties) practicing long-range shooting.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Losing weight.
I‚Äôve lost ~11lbs in the last 5 months, an average of 2.2lbs per month.
If I can keep up that rate, I‚Äôll reach my goal weight of 189lbs in 13.6 months.
Geez, that‚Äôs January 20<em>25</em>.
Sounds like early 2025 will be cathartic time for me.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I‚Äôve noticed my attitude towards money has shifted recently.
For years, I‚Äôve wanted to keep open the option of taking a major career risk, so I wanted to save as much as possible.
But nowadays, I‚Äôm pretty happy and could see myself staying at Microsoft for a few more years, at least.
I am fortunate that money is not a scarce resource for me and I can use it to save time and make my life better.
I still try not to overspend, but I don‚Äôt let it dominate my decisions as much anymore.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Went to Mexico with Z:
Ixtapa, Mexico City, Queretaro, and San Miguel de Allende.</p></div>

<h3 id="coding">Coding</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Mainly working on this site, <a href="/vbook/">okjuan.me/vbook</a>.
It‚Äôs been tricky because I don‚Äôt know any Ruby and don‚Äôt want to invest time into learning it right now.
So far, I‚Äôve gotten by on documentation and other people‚Äôs examples.
Most recently, I added backlinks, with some <a href="https://www.daniel.industries/2023/01/29/really-basic-backlinks-in-jekyll/">help from Daniel Miller</a>.
I also made tags the main way to navigate the site by folding ‚Äòcategories‚Äô into them.
Not only is this cleaner and more uniform, but it also allows me to assign multiple categories (now tags) to the same post.
For example, a post can now be ‚Äòfiled‚Äô under both <a href="/vbook/tags/essays/">#essays</a> and <a href="/vbook/tags/journal/">#journal</a>.
See <a href="https://www.mentalnodes.com/folders-kill-creativity">Folders kill creativity</a>.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I still really want to make and deploy a front-end for <a href="https://github.com/okjuan/music-lib-bot">music-lib-bot</a>.
A web app would make sense, but I also like the idea of an SMS interface or something of the like.
Maybe even something integrated into Google Assistant.</p></div>

  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">

    <div class="paragraph"><p>In elementary school I chose my outfits for one thing: recess.
<!--more-->
And recess meant one thing: soccer.
Indoor soccer shoes, soccer shorts, and one of my soccer jerseys.
I didn‚Äôt need pockets back then.
I took those games during recess very seriously.
One time after scoring a goal I took off one of my red and black <a href="https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/VTAAAOSwubFjyJXm/s-l1600.jpg">Adidas Predator</a> indoor cleats to celebrate <a href="https://www.si.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTY4MTg1NjkzNDExMDkxODQw/blancoamericajpg.jpg">like Cuauht√©moc Blanco</a>.
Instead of a crowd of fans I looked up at a big vine-covered wall.
Getting back up I realized one of the girls in my grade was looking at me.
She looked bewildered.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>But the outfits weren‚Äôt just a practical matter.
I loved how they looked.
Especially when they had three stripes on the sleeves.
My snooty snot-nosed self looked down on anything with four stripes.
Or, God forbid, five.
Unfortunately, Club Am√©rica ‚Äì the Mexican soccer team I supported and the one Cuauht√©moc Blanco played for ‚Äì wore Nike.
I dreamt one day they would return to Adidas.
But then Nike started designing <a href="https://cf.ijersey.ru/upload/ttmall/img/20220316/c4c23dd9c310d06fff0a51e549abf2bf.png=z-550,550_f-webp">retro-inspired jerseys</a> that caught my eye.
Intrigued, but devoted to the three stripes, I drew and colored imaginary Adidas-branded Club Am√©rica jerseys and tacked them up on the corkboard above my desk.
I can probably still draw both logos from memory.
The Adidas one is trickier than you‚Äôd think.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Then I found out about Abercrombie &amp; Fitch.
We didn‚Äôt have one in Mexico, so the prodigal sons strutting around in their <a href="https://images.asos-media.com/products/abercrombie-fitch-stretch-core-moose-icon-logo-slim-fit-polo-in-aqua/9514100-1-aqua?$n_640w$&amp;wid=513&amp;fit=constrain">branded polo shirts</a> must‚Äôve gone shopping in the States.
I wish I could remember what I thought about it at first.
Did I care?
Some part of me must‚Äôve known that little moose was bull.
But at that age intuition gives way easily to the cool kid decree.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Before I had a chance to buy into the hype, my parents announced that we were moving to the States.
And right in time for me to experience the fabled American institution of middle school.
That summer, while our parents dealt with the logistics of moving a six-person family from Mexico City to the suburbs of New York, my siblings and I watched nauseating amounts of Nickelodeon and Disney Channel.
This time it was my older sister staring at me as I took diligent notes from <em>Ned‚Äôs Declassified School Survival Guide</em>.
I loved neat and simple rules, and relished the idea that they codified everything.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Ned‚Äôs tips were good, but not nearly as influential as his outfits were.
Now it would be my turn to strut through the hallways in an open button up with a t-shirt underneath.
And if the button-up were to have a little moose on the chest, then so be it.
(It‚Äôs fortunate I didn‚Äôt discover mirrored aviators until later.
I would‚Äôve been too powerful.)
I recreated it with Abercrombie button-ups and striped sweatpants from The Children‚Äôs Place.
(One big stripe was an admissible, if humbler, alternative to the three.)
On more modest days I wore one of my graphic tees, like my navy blue long-sleeve that read, in letters stylized as ice cubes, <em>COOL AS ICE</em>.
Another favorite was a black short-sleeve with <em>The Dark Side of the Moon</em> album cover on it.
I knew nothing about Pink Floyd but it seemed like a cool thing to wear.
Plus, the material was so soft, it was like wearing a pajama top.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>On those first few weeks, I swaggered through the halls in my new outfits, savoring my authentique am√©ricain lifestyle.
But the quippy repartee that I anticipated happening in the busy halls wasn‚Äôt as natural in the secluded corner of the school, where the sixth grade lockers were.
Plus, opening a locker wasn‚Äôt the 3-second operation that TV had assured me existed mainly as backdrop for flirting between classes.
I don‚Äôt know at what summer camp all those Nickelodeon teens and teens got their bank-heist finger agility.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Even lunch time was a sobering affair.
My idealized vision of middle school suffered a severe blow when the ever-grouchy ketchup-haired lunch lady rung up my lunch food at more than the three bucks my mom gave me.
Apparently I was supposed to look at the prices and add them up to a total, like an adult at a grocery store or something.
I figured the transaction was more cultural than monetary.
You give me lunch, I give you lunch money.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>But the cool kid crowd whose law I now observed wasn‚Äôt concerned with button-ups, graphic tees, moose, or even stripes.
It was all about the shoes.
Skateboarding shoes, specifically.
Etnies, DCs, and, for those with bolder taste, <a href="https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/bYsAAOSwFJNkLzje/s-l1600.jpg">Osiris high tops</a>.
(Other cool kid crowds were innovating in different directions, with <a href="https://images.vestiairecollective.com/cdn-cgi/image/w=1024,q=75,f=auto,/produit/black-cotton-ed-hardy-t-shirt-29333521-1_3.jpg">Ed Hardy t-shirts</a> and such.)
I wasn‚Äôt confident about how I‚Äôd look in a pair of chunky skate shoes, but the allure of the group convinced me to take the leap.
I vied for membership with a respectable bid: Nike SB 6.0s, the ones <a href="https://ep1.pinkbike.org/p3pb2717883/p3pb2717883.jpg">with the thick tongue</a>.
At first, they felt like part of a costume.
For years, my criterion for shoes had been that they would allow me to play soccer at a moment‚Äôs notice.
Even dress shoes had to be conducive to good ball control.
Nonetheless, my chunky new SBs became my main pair of shoes, even though they‚Äôd often fly off my foot after kicking a ball.
I loved how they looked.
At some point, despite my scandalized father, I took a black Sharpie to them and drew flames and other bits on the side of the soles.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>In high school, one of my best friends was very amused by the semi-formal attire I changed into after class one day, hoping to impress an exchange student at a group dinner that evening.
(This was in the early 2010s, before ‚Äúlooking like a dad‚Äù could be positive.)
To be fair, my outfit was nearly indistinguishable from our private school uniform.
I didn‚Äôt look like I was going out with my fellow 15 year-olds, but like I was going to evening mass.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>It was tricky to dress my age given my dad‚Äôs impulse to impress his preferences on me and my brother during our gender-segregated trips to the outlet mall.
(<em>Pobre ni√±os, I only took them to Tommy Hilfiger, Lacoste, Polo Ralph Lauren, Calvin Klein‚Ä¶</em>)
The boys enjoyed an efficient tour through the collared, emblemed world of business casual while the girls enjoyed going shopping.
(The gleeful shopping spree where I realized my <em>Ned</em> outfit for middle school was casually sponsored by my mom on one of the days where a breach opened in the gender divide, leading into a world of abundant oks and yeah sures.)
Luckily for me, my dad also highly approved of Adidas.
Actually, it was he who gave me the <em>Impossible is Nothing</em> poster that hung on my bedroom wall, featuring a looming Muhammad Ali, an arm-slinged Beckenbauer, and various other figures of iron resolve.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>My dad would never have taken us thrift shopping, and yet he supplied me and my brother with some prime vintage pieces.
He kept some of his clothes for decades, despite the fact they didn‚Äôt fit him anymore.
I suppose he foresaw the possibility of their inheritance, or maybe he collected them for no practical reason like he did his military school uniform and racecar magazines.
In our late teens and early twenties, my brother and I mined my dad‚Äôs store of 80s and 90s attire for bona fide retro items.
It was like going thrift shopping, except the old man was no stranger.
And it was free.
I guess thrift stores charge for the mystery.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>My kids are unlikely to enjoy the same luck.
At the peak of my ‚Äúminimalist‚Äù phase in my late teens and early twenties ‚Äî as my mom admiringly called it ‚Äî I got rid of a lot of stuff.
Probably too much stuff.
My dad had to talk me out of getting rid of my school yearbooks.
One of the things I regret getting rid of is a Club Am√©rica t-shirt signed by a teenage Memo Ochoa, the talented up-and-coming Mexican goalie who, ten or fifteen years later, made outrageous saves <a href="https://youtu.be/Cm_pMHQokZo">at the 2018 World Cup</a> in Brazil to deny the likes of Neymar.
I got to meet him when I was eight years old and playing in the Club Am√©rica youth academy, which was real enough to summon a couple first team players for a meet-and-greet after practice one day.
Actually, I even got to stand on the field at the legendary Estadio Azteca ‚Äì site of Maradona‚Äôs infamous <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/The_hand_of_God">Hand of God</a>
in the 1986 World Cup ‚Äì before kickoff at a Club Am√©rica game.
My teammates and I were lined up to high-five the players as they came out onto the field, but most of them didn‚Äôt stretch their arms far enough to make contact with us.
I remember feeling quite annoyed.
I guess that was easier than feeling disappointed.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I also regret getting rid of a particular red polo shirt from my childhood.
I had no shortage of embroidered polo shirts, but this one was special.
It was the one I wore on the fateful day I crossed paths with none other than Cuauht√©moc Blanco.
It was orchestrated not by the academy but by chance, and by the universal appeal of Six Flags.
I came off my second ride of the Superman rollercoaster to find out that my friend‚Äôs <em>chofer</em>, who was accompanying me because none of my friends wanted to go on the rollercoaster, had seen Cuauht√©moc.
I couldn‚Äôt believe it.
Why didn‚Äôt you get his autograph?
Because I know him from back in the day, I used to play soccer with him.
Where did he go?</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Sure enough, there he was ‚Äì standing in a crowd of parents watching their children on one of the kiddie rides.
Some of the parents were wearing Club Am√©rica jerseys, but none of them were looking at him.
I couldn‚Äôt believe nobody recognized him, but then again I barely did, in his dark sunglasses and white t-shirt advertising a splashing Aquafina water bottle.
A shrewd disguise.
I guess it also helped that he naturally looked less like a Mexican soccer star and more like a Mexican Tony Soprano.
I waited for the kiddie ride to end and, as the parents dispersed, I approached him, heart thumping.
Straight to the point: can I have an autograph?
He paused, said nothing, glanced quickly over his shoulder, took the pen my friend‚Äôs chofer had given me, found the top corner of my shirt, and signed it.
When I got back to my friends, they couldn‚Äôt believe it.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>In my university years, some of my friends developed a special affinity for Four Horsemen (4H), our local casual-yet-high-end clothing store.
(Street wear?)
The walls were all white, the clothes were expensive, the music was hip, and the employees even hipper.
I browsed often but rarely purchased anything.
And yet I spent hundreds of dollars there.
All I remember buying is a pair of <a href="https://i5.walmartimages.com/asr/a396975e-5179-4c8d-ba54-7f35ad0f9405.991d8e29db17eb16b368646b49a6da9c.jpeg">New Balances 999s</a>, two pairs of black Chapter pants, and a pair of roomy, pleated, grey, speckled 4H pants, which I still love.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>The special emphasis on pants is due to the difficulty I have buying pants that don‚Äôt smother my thighs.
In fact, it was from one of the Four Horsemen workers that I first heard <em>thick</em> as slang, when I was trying on the grey pants.
I laughed nervously before escaping back into the fitting room.
I bought a size up and got a tailor to shorten the waist.
After years of tapering the end of my employee-discounted Tommy Hilfiger chino pants by folding the hem, those grey pants were a departure.
Looking at the loose hems in the fitting room, I was doubtful I could pull it off.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>During a day trip to Vancouver with that same friend group, I ended up splurging on an olive-colored <a href="https://www.johnelliott.com/cdn/shop/products/HOODED_VILLAIN_OLIVE_06_1424x.jpg?v=1569005291">John Elliott Hooded Villain</a> sweater.
The side-zipper design surged in popularity, high enough for H&amp;M to mimic, and then crashed back down.
Ritchie with a T, in the outro of Injury Reserve‚Äôs ‚ÄúAll This Money‚Äù:</p></div>

  <div class="paragraph"><p>I don‚Äôt even know who‚Äôs idea it was to put a zipper on the side</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I wore it religiously for at least a year, most often under a vintage Tommy Hilfiger jean jacket that my smiling dad let me steal from his collection.
I still have the hoodie in my closet.
Maybe I‚Äôll keep it for my kids to gape at in a couple decades.
If it‚Äôs not cool again by then, at least it‚Äôll be novel.</p></div>

    <div class="paragraph"><p><em>As Daudi Abe tells in his 2020 book,</em> <a href="https://uwapress.uw.edu/book/9780295747569/emerald-street/">Emerald Street: A History of Hip Hop in Seattle</a><em>, the city‚Äôs black folks first set down roots in Central District (the CD) in the late 1880s.</em> <!--more--> <em>After World War II, during the Second Great Migration, Seattle‚Äôs black population soared into the tens of thousands, 80% of which lived in the CD by the mid 1960s. In recent decades, the portion of black residents in the CD has declined due in part to gentrification. Nonetheless, the black community‚Äôs influence on the life of this neighborhood remains alive and well.</em></p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Cherry Street runs down one of Seattle‚Äôs many hills, past <a href="https://www.206zulu.org/">206 Zulu</a> headquarters at Washington Hall, up another hill, and down again into a cluster of Ethiopian restaurants and other black-owned businesses. Among them is Seattle‚Äôs first black-owned brewery, M√©tier Brewing Community Taproom, which opened last summer here in the CD, which <a href="https://metierbrewing.com/locations/cherry-street/">M√©tier calls</a> ‚Äúthe heart and soul of Black Seattle‚Äù.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I had never heard of M√©tier Brewing when my friends called to invite me down. They had come to M√©tier for a drink and found a jazz trio performing for free. It sounded good over the phone. I arrived in time to catch only one song before the band took a break. I recognized the tune, but couldn‚Äôt remember what it was. Masego, maybe? While I ordered an IPA and a kimchi pork <em>okazu pan</em> at the bar, I got a chance to ask the keyboard player, Brandon J. Young. The song was Footprints by Wayne Shorter, the jazz giant who passed away that very day at the age of 89. I realized later that I recognized it from Madlib‚Äôs Shades of Blue, an instrumental hip hop album assembled from the archives of Blue Note jazz records.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>On the way back to my table, I passed a wall emblazoned with the brewery‚Äôs promise: <strong>Brew Damn Good Beer, Build Stronger Community, Inspire Bigger Dreams For Everyone</strong>. In keeping with their mission statement, M√©tier had recently partnered with NW Folklife to offer free live music every first Thursday, and this month‚Äôs artist was the Chris Patin Band (pronounced Pot-tan). The trio‚Äôs drummer and leader had attended high school down the street at Garfield High thirty or so years ago and played in their winning Jazz Combo. Longer ago, Garfield‚Äôs jazz program educated a young Quincy Jones.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Soon, the band settled back behind their instruments for the second half of the set, this time joined by a singer and Freddy ‚ÄòFuego‚Äô Gonzalez on trombone. Freddy introduced the singer and warned us we didn‚Äôt know what we were in for. Seconds into ‚ÄúFeeling Good‚Äù it was clear that Freddy wasn‚Äôt talking her up. Here was not only a talented singer but a performer with a presence befitting a stage the size of this whole taproom. And yet here she was singing among the wooden benches where we sat drinking. Singing for free, for the community.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Next, the band launched into a version of ‚ÄúFever‚Äù infused with a Buena Vista Social Club-style rhythm. The singer swayed and stepped as she sang, but the small crowd was too shy to be beckoned up onto their feet. I grooved in my seat, head bopping, foot bouncing. The song ended but the singer hadn‚Äôt given up on us. As the band started playing the slow, unmistakable intro to ‚ÄúStand By Me‚Äù, the singer started recruiting us one by one.</p></div>

<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>And you, you‚Äôre bopping your head, that means you have rhythm.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>She lined the four of us up side by side as the intro came to an end.</p></div>

<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>Just dance til your soul is happy!‚Ä¶ <strong>When the night‚Ä¶ has come‚Ä¶</strong></p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I just finished 2 books: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43306206-the-courage-to-be-disliked">The Courage to be Disliked</a> by Ichiro Kishimi and Fumitake Koga and <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52386552-into-the-abyss">Into the Abyss: A Neuropsychiatrist‚Äôs Notes on Troubled Minds</a> by Anthony David.
<em>The Courage</em> was thought-provoking and written in a novel form.
See Derek Sivers‚Äô <a href="https://sive.rs/book/Disliked">notes</a> on it.
<em>Into the Abyss</em> was full of fascinating cases and some good insight.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Recently read Anthony Lane‚Äôs hilarious New Yorker article, <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/10/23/build-the-life-you-want-the-art-and-science-of-getting-happier-oprah-winfrey-and-arthur-c-brooks-book-review">Can Happiness Be Taught?</a>
It‚Äôs a review of recent best-seller <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/137978862-build-the-life-you-want">Build the Life You Want: The Art and Science of Getting Happier</a>, written by a Professor of Management Practice at Harvard Business School and sponsored by Oprah Winfrey.
One of my favorite bits:</p></div>

<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>‚Ä¶imperative reigns supreme. ‚ÄúStart by working on your toughness.‚Äù No sweat. ‚ÄúTake your grand vision of improvement and humble ambition to be part of it in a specific way and execute accordingly.‚Äù Check. ‚ÄúRebel against your shame.‚Äù Done. ‚ÄúWiden your conflict-resolution repertoire.‚Äù Ka-pow! ‚ÄúTreat your walks, prayer time, and gym sessions as if they were meetings with the president.‚Äù Which President? ‚ÄúJournal your experiences and feelings over the course of the day.‚Äù Since when did ‚Äújournal‚Äù turn into a transitive verb? ‚ÄúDig into the extensive and growing technology and literature on mindfulness.‚Äù Sorry, I was miles away, what? Above all, ‚ÄúRemember: You are your own CEO.‚Äù Holy moly. Do I have to wear a suit to brush my teeth? Is my dog a shareholder? Were last year‚Äôs migraines tax-deductible? Can I be fired by me?</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Last month, I read the first part of Jane Jacobs‚Äô famous <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30833.The_Death_and_Life_of_Great_American_Cities">The Death and Life of Great American Cities</a>.
To my surprise, it‚Äôs great so far.
I expected it to be much drier, as I‚Äôm sure many books about city and neighborhood planning are.
I bought a copy and intend to read it over the next couple months.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>While traveling in Mexico, I read a bit of <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29358301-vital-little-plans">Vital Little Plans: The Short Works of Jane Jacobs</a>.

  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">

    <div class="paragraph"><p>Half memoir, half advice for aspiring fiction writers.
Both good.
<!--more--></p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I enjoy and mostly trust his <a id="2023-12-09-king-writing-advice" class="" href="/vbook/writing-advice">writing advice</a>.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>This is yet <a id="2021-08-06-possibilities" class="" href="/vbook/possibilities">another</a> book that should be made <a id="2023-08-11-virtual-book" class="" href="/vbook/virtual-book">virtual</a>.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>It consists of three distinct parts: a memoir of King‚Äôs life; advice for fiction writers; and a vignette about King‚Äôs near-death experience.
(Really, it consists of two different types of writing: memoir and practical advice.)
King claims that he included the memoir to contextualize his fiction, but I don‚Äôt buy it.
I suspect he set out to write this book without a coherent vision for it.
In fact, that‚Äôs how he usually writes!</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I am glad he wrote all three parts.
And they don‚Äôt go terribly together.
But they‚Äôd go better with many other things, too, including things written by other people.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>The simplest way to make this book virtual is to publish it digitally as three separate pieces that readers can choose to consume as they see fit.
This is already an improvement.
Aspiring writers could jump directly to the second piece ‚Äì the one that <em>is</em> actually King‚Äôs thoughts ‚Äúon writing‚Äù ‚Äì and King‚Äôs fans could hear about their beloved author‚Äôs background and personal life without having to hear his opinions on grammar and diction.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Each of the three pieces could be divided into smaller chunks.
The piece about writing, for example, could be broken down into King‚Äôs thoughts on dialogue, his thoughts on grammar, on character depiction, plot design, etc.
The book is already organized into chapters, but they cannot be consumed independently of the book.
If the chapters were designed to exist independently, they could be easily linked to by other works: books, articles, websites, videos, etc.
King‚Äôs book would be only one of many pieces that contained his memoirs and his thoughts on writing.</p></div>

  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">

    <div class="paragraph"><p>This is my second review of this book.
I have to say ‚Äì it won me over, big time.
<!--more-->
This time I read a physical copy, and it was worth it.
The spacing and formatting of the print gives the book a mysterious aura.
You feel you‚Äôre conferring secretly with the author about a strange magic that hides in prose.
He reveals what he‚Äôs learned about teasing this elusive substance into the right configurations.
In the same words he explains to you and shows you.
Some books about writing are sterile and tedious, but this book is on the other end of the spectrum.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Some of its advice has lodged into my writing brain:</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Keep the space between sentences as empty as possible‚Ä¶</strong>
<strong>Most sentences need no preamble - nor postlude.</strong></p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Avoid writing your sentence.</strong>
<strong>Play with it in your head.</strong>
<strong>The range of possible sentence structures narrows after every word you put down.</strong></p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Don‚Äôt be afraid that you‚Äôll forget a good sentence or a good idea.</strong>
<strong>Trust yourself.</strong>
<strong>If it is important, you‚Äôll remember it.</strong></p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Lots of worthwhile ideas, many of which aim to loosen rigid rules and challenge habits taught in school.
Are transition words and sentences really necessary?
Do you trust your reader so little?
<strong>You can get anywhere from anywhere.</strong>
It also challenges conventional wisdom regarding ‚Äúinspiration‚Äù, ‚Äúnatural‚Äù writing, and ‚Äúflowing‚Äù writing.
It gives interesting writing exercises like putting sentences each on their own line to compare structure, length, and rhythm.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I realized on second read that the author asserts in the introduction that this book is not dogma, but a collection of starting points.
Also, my prayers were answered: the book contains a healthy share of sample prose.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Very glad I came across this book.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Last month (whew!) I also read a bit of Gloria Steinem‚Äôs <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/335090.Revolution_from_Within">Revolution from Within</a>, which I found on one of my dutiful visits to my local Goodwill.
It‚Äôs pretty interesting.
The story about the Royal Knights of East Harlem was really moving.</p></div>

  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">

    <div class="paragraph"><p>My first attempt to review a book <em>while</em> I read it instead of waiting until I finish it.
<!--more--></p></div>

<h4 id="year-of-glad">YEAR OF GLAD</h4>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Main character: (new) Hal Incandenza, reading savant and tennis prodigy.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I‚Äôd actually listened to this chapter on audiobook years ago.
My friend Jon told me about this book long ago, before I knew of its literary renown (or <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/11/05/how-to-read-infinite-jest">its notoriety</a> as a status symbol for intellect-signalers.)
I remembered it being funny and very absurd.
Indeed it is.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Wallace‚Äôs descriptions are inventive.</p></div>
<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>..the air of the room, the bits of dust and sportcoat-lint stirred around by the AC‚Äôs vents dancing jaggedly in the slanted plane of windowlight, the air over the table like the sparkling space just above a fresh-poured seltzer.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Another bit stuck in my mind is his description of the conference room being ‚Äúdouble-windowed against the November heat.‚Äù
It‚Äôs late fall in the US, but it‚Äôs hot?
This is said in the third sentence of the first chapter, laying down the first brick of mounting absurdity.
Or maybe I just don‚Äôt know US climate that well.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>My only problem with this chapter is that it‚Äôs hard to keep track of all the characters and names.
I prefer being able to picture the correct number of people.
I don‚Äôt think quantity is the problem though, because I am quite content, for example, keeping track of the dozens of characters in <em>The Sopranos</em>.
I am much more comfortable doing it with visuals.</p></div>

<h4 id="year-of-the-depend-adult-undergarment">YEAR OF THE DEPEND ADULT UNDERGARMENT</h4>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Main character: (new) Erdedy, isolated man with marijuana addiction.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I enjoyed this chapter more, I think because it was much easier to follow, but also probably because I read it when I had a lot of mental energy.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I assume Wallace‚Äôs obsessive personality and problems with addiction helped him create this very vivid scene where Erdedy meticulously arranges another ‚Äúfinal‚Äù binge of marijuana, junk food, action movies, and masturbation.
Wallace uses <a id="2023-06-30-narrate-transparently" class="" href="/vbook/narrate-transparently">transparent narration</a> and stream-of-consciousness to put us inside Erdedy‚Äôs head.
It feels like we have access to the character‚Äôs thoughts because they flit between subjects without transition:</p></div>
<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>He had not sat down and outright bold-faced lied to her, it had been more of an impression he‚Äôd conveyed and nurtured and allowed to gather its own life and force. The insect was now entirely visible. It was on the shelf that held his digital equalizer. What looked like its reemergence might just have been a change in his attention or the two windows‚Äô light or the visual context of his surroundings. The girder protruded from the wall and was a triangle of dull steel with holes for shelves to fit into. The metal shelves that held his audio equipment were painted a dark industrial green and were originally made for holding canned goods. They were designed to be extra kitchen shelves. The insect sat inside its dark shiny case with an immobility that seemed like the gathering of a force, it sat like the hull of a vehicle from which the engine had been for the moment removed. It was dark and had a shiny case and antennae that protruded but did not move. He had to use the bathroom. His last piece of contact from the appropriation artist, with whom he had had intercourse, and who during intercourse had sprayed some sort of perfume up into the air from a mister she held in her left hand as she lay beneath him making a wide variety of sounds and spraying perfume up into the air, so that he felt the cold mist of it settling on his back and shoulders and was chilled and repelled, his last piece of contact after he‚Äôd gone into hiding with the marijuana she‚Äôd gotten for him had been a card she‚Äôd mailed that was a pastiche photo of a doormat of coarse green plastic grass with WELCOME on it and next to it a flattering publicity photo of the appropriation artist from her Back Bay gallery, and between them an unequal sign, which was an equal sign with a diagonal slash across it, and also an obscenity he has assumed was directed at him magisculed in red grease pencil along the bottom, with multiple exclamation points.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>All throughout, ideas branch off in unorganized directions.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>The redundant descriptions ‚Äì like the insect‚Äôs <em>dark, shiny case</em> and the woman <em>spraying perfume up into the air</em> ‚Äì suggest what the character is focusing on, in his head.
Particular details like these make their corresponding images more vivid not only for the reader, but also for the character whose mind we are seeing them through.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>The excerpt above is only a fragment of a paragraph four pages in length, which follows a paragraph almost five pages in length.
These two uninterrupted streams of thought have the effect of submerging us in Erdedy‚Äôs neurotic consciousness as he waits for and obsesses over an expected delivery of marijuana.</p></div>

<h4 id="1-april--year-of-the-tucks-medicated-pad">1 APRIL ‚Äì YEAR OF THE TUCKS MEDICATED PAD</h4>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Main character: (recurring) Hal Incandenza, reading savant and tennis prodigy.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Another funny and absurd scene featuring Hal.
Confusingly, in this one, he is articulate and witty.
There is reference but no evidence of his being nonverbal.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Following his dad‚Äôs instruction, Hal meets with a self-proclaimed ‚Äúprofessional conversationalist‚Äù, who is obtuse and confrontational and who turns out to be Hal‚Äôs dad in poor disguise.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>A slightly annoying aspect of this chapter is that it jumps between seemingly random topics with no apparent point.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Hal‚Äôs dad says something about his wife cheating with lots of people.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>For some reason, Hal calls his dad ‚ÄòHimself‚Äô and his mom ‚Äòthe Moms‚Äô.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>In this chatper there is first mention of some topics that come up in later chapters, including a medical attach√© and Byzantine erotica.
There‚Äôs also mention of Quebec, which, unless I‚Äôm hallucinating, is also mentioned once, in a throwaway comment, in the first chapter.</p></div>

<h4 id="9-may--year-of-the-depend-adult-undergarment">9 MAY ‚Äì YEAR OF THE DEPEND ADULT UNDERGARMENT</h4>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Main character: (recurring) Hal Incandenza, reading savant and tennis prodigy.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Hal packs his tennis bag in the darkness of 6am.
The phone rings and wakes Hal‚Äôs brother and roommate, Mario.
A brief, mysterious phone call from Orin (new character).
Hal seems unbothered.</p></div>

<h4 id="year-of-the-depend-adult-undergarment-1">YEAR OF THE DEPEND ADULT UNDERGARMENT</h4>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Main character: (new) medical attach√©, special ear-nose-throat consultant to the personal physician of Prince Q‚Äî-, the Saudi Minister of Home Entertainment.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Another funny and absurd chapter.
Our anonymous main character‚Äôs job is tending to the yeasty sores that regularly break out on Prince Q‚Äî-‚Äòs face due to his compulsive consumption of Toblerone.
The doctor earned his post because he‚Äôs so skilled in dealing with the condition:</p></div>
<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>A veritable artist, possessed of a deftness nonpareil with cotton swab and evacuation-hypo, the medical attach√© is known among the shrinking upper classes of petro-Arab nations as the DeBakey of maxillofacial yeast, his staggering fee-scale as wholly <em>ad valorem</em></p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>His work, however, is so exhausting that every night he follows the same decompression routine ‚Äì an unsettling variation on the familiar TV dinner routine ‚Äì that his servant-wife orchestrates.</p></div>
<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>He reclines before the viewer in his special electronic recliner, and his black-veiled, ethnically Arab wife wordlessly attends him, loosening any constrictive clothing, adjusting the room‚Äôs lighting, fitting the complexly molded dinner tray over his head so that his shoulders support the tray and allow it to project into space just below his chin, that he may enjoy his hot dinner without having to remove his eyes from whatever entertainment is up and playing.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>This chapter and Erdedy‚Äôs earlier chapter are my favorites so far.
(Maybe I enjoy detailed scenes that focus on a single character?)</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>PS ‚Äì This man must be somehow relevant to Himself‚Äôs mention of medical attach√©s that the Moms supposedly had affairs with?</p></div>

<h4 id="year-of-the-trial-size-dove-bar">YEAR OF THE TRIAL-SIZE DOVE BAR</h4>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Main characters: (new) Wardine and (new) Bruce Green.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>It consists of two, unrelated vignettes of unfortunate people living pitiful lives.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>First vignette ‚Äì
Wardine is a teenage girl who is being horribly abused by her mother and uncle.
The characters in this vignette are coded as being black and from a poor area.
They talk in really basic pidgin English.
It‚Äôs uncomfortable to read.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Second vignette ‚Äì
Bruce Green is a high school student who manages to attract the attention of a ‚Äúfatally pretty‚Äù classmate, Mildred Bonk.
He gets her pregnant and they drop out of school to live in a housetrailer with their baby and three other people, one of whom keeps ‚Äúseveral large snakes in unclean unconvered aquaria.‚Äù</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>The most unexpected chapter so far.
Inexplicable by itself.</p></div>

<h4 id="year-of-the-depend-adult-undergarment-2">YEAR OF THE DEPEND ADULT UNDERGARMENT</h4>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Main character: (recurring) Hal Incandenza, reading savant and tennis prodigy.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Hal chats with his older brother Mario.
Even though Hal is younger, the dynamic is palpably reverse.
Mario asks lots of questions and Hal calls Mario Booboo.
Mario asks Hal why he doesn‚Äôt believe in God if he is so good at tennis.
Hal says:</p></div>
<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>God seems to have a kind of laid-back management style I‚Äôm not crazy about. I‚Äôm pretty much anti-death. God looks by all accounts to be pro-death. I‚Äôm not seeing how we can get together on this issue.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Mario then asks why the Moms didn‚Äôt get sad about Himself‚Äôs death.
Hal tries to persuade Mario that she is sad, but Hal doesn‚Äôt seem sure of it either.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>The chapter ends with reference to the medical attach√©, who is watching an unmarked video that was delivered to him seemingly by mistake.</p></div>

<h4 id="october--year-of-the-depend-adult-undergarment">OCTOBER ‚Äì YEAR OF THE DEPEND ADULT UNDERGARMENT</h4>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Orin.
Perhaps he lives in the same condo complex as Erdedy?</p></div>
</div>
<a class="u-url" href="/vbook/infinite-jest" hidden></a>
</article>

      </div>
    </div></div><p>.
I don‚Äôt have a very good reason to do so, though.
So we‚Äôll see.</p></div>

<h3 id="tv">TV</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>The Sopranos for the second time.
Amazed at the writing, once again.
They follow so many characters and develop so many dynamics at the same time.
Many story lines don‚Äôt build to a climax and exist instead to develop characters and prepare future story lines.
Some just exist because they‚Äôre true to life.
Like when Carmela and Tony struggle to keep their rebellious daughter in check.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Couples Therapy, season 3.
So insightful and fascinating.
Orna is an amazing therapist.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Welcome to Wrexham, season 2.
I don‚Äôt think any other show has made me cry as much as this one, and I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs because I love soccer so much.
The show has so much heart.</p></div>

<h3 id="movies">Movies</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Rewatched Roma and Coco with my wife, who hadn‚Äôt seen either, while we were in Mexico.
I love doing activities that thematically or topically match other things I‚Äôm doing in life.</p></div>

<hr>

<h3 id="whats-next">What‚Äôs next?</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>File my wife‚Äôs green card papers.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Keep reading, keep writing.
Holidays are great for this.
Or so I always think.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Keep improving the design of this website.
Allow people to subscribe via RSS and email.
Add ‚Äòlast updated‚Äô timestamp per post.
Tweak padding in title-subtitle-date-tags section of posts.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Keep losing weight.
Not so great for this, holidays.
Or so people say.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Holidays in Victoria.
Time with family and friends.</p></div>
