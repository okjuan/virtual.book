    <div class="paragraph"><p>I had this encounter in October of 2022, almost two years ago.
<!--more-->
Immediately after Bob left my apartment, I snatched a pen and notebook to take down as much as I could remember verbatim before it slipped out of my mind.
I had no particular vision for what I would write, but I was sure Bob’s personality was worth capturing.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>At the time I’d already spent over a year reading pieces of <a href="https://okjuan.me/vbook/tags/new-journalism/">New Journalism</a> and I imagined I could take inspiration from pieces like Lillian Ross’s portrait of Hemingway, an infamous <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1950/05/13/how-do-you-like-it-now-gentlemen">magazine article</a> that was later printed on its own <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42685.Portrait_of_Hemingway">as a book</a>.
Tom Wolfe, delighted, called it an evisceration.
But Ross had no such intention.
And Hemingway, apparently, loved it.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>As I sit down on my couch in this blazing August sun, I still don’t know how I’m going to write this.
As I begin, I realize I am already sticking to a certain tense and point of view.
Let me instead write down the sequence of events with bits of detail I remember, and later I’ll fit it into a form.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Wow.
That worked.
The whole thing just spilled out as soon as I stopped trying to construct the first few sentences so self-consciously.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I’m tweaking the first few sentences, but they already work quite well.
I intended them to be placeholders, but they may hold their place after all.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I think I can leave it as it is, at least for now.
It communicates Bob’s buoyant spirit and his delightful way of speaking, which is the main reason I wanted to write this piece.
It’s good enough to post.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Now it’s the following morning and I’m making small edits.
Tweaking phrasing, rewriting one sentence, and capitalizing the first letter of phrases when Bob was quoting others.</p></div>
