  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">

    <div class="paragraph"><p>In her novel <em>Normal People</em>, Sally Rooney exposes the hidden reasoning of our subconscious.
<!--more-->
She does so primarily by translating into clear words the opaque subconscious reasoning of both her protagonists, Connell and Marianne.
If they were real people, these characters would experience their thoughts not as Rooney’s sentences but as intuitive feelings and inarticulate notions.
But we as readers get privileged access to their thoughts and feelings through the backdoor entrance of Rooney’s prose.
This special access has two major effects.
One, we understand these characters intimately.
In a way perhaps that they would not understand themselves.
And two, we are reminded that we also experience internally an unending stream of unrefined thought.
We too are partially in the dark about our intentions and motivations.
That this level of semiconscious thought exists and that our understanding of it can be sharpened through introspection and articulation are useful observations Rooney offers us.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Another way that Rooney puts unconscious reasoning on display in her book is by having her characters make choices that seem unmotivated or arbitrary, but prove meaningful in effect.
Following are two examples of this, one minor and one major.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>A minor example is when Connell and his mother Lorraine give Marianne a ride home from the grocery store.
Connell chooses to drop his mother off first.
Is it a coincidence that this gives him some private time with Marianne?
Lorraine begins collecting the groceries to take them inside, but Connell stops her and says he will do it later.
This seems at first an odd detail for the author to include.
But its purpose becomes clear when Connell declines Marianne’s invitation to come in for tea.
<em>Oh, I would, but there’s ice cream in the boot.</em>
Rooney is showing us that this was a calculated decision.
Connell contrived the situation to contain a convenient excuse.
What isn’t clear is whether Connell is fully conscious of his calculations.
It seems like the kind of decision he might recognize only in retrospect as deliberate.
And until he does, until he admits to himself that only some of his decisions are made in full consciousness, he cannot be fully selfaware.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>A similar but more major example is Marianne’s choice to tell Connell that her new boyfriend Jamie is a sadist.
On the surface, this is a bizarre choice.
Why confess this, unprompted, to an ex-boyfriend?
Is she being cruel, trying to make Connell jealous?
When Connell reacts with alarm, Marianne plays it off with a “cute little smile.”
Nonchalantly, she continues.
<em>[He] likes to beat me up. Just during sex, that is. Not during arguments.</em>
Marianne’s behavior seems odd and clumnsy, but it’s not.
She has invited Connell for coffee to tell him – the same person to whom she confided about being physically abused by her father – that her new boyfriend beats her up during sex.
She is crying for help.
Or at least for some sort of attention.
But is she doing this with awareness?
Is her casual tone a mask to hide her feelings from Connell?
Or is she concealing them from herself as well?
Her amusement is likely a real feeling encasing the truer feelings of desperation and selfloathing.
This enigmatic form of communication reflects the contradiction inside Marianne.
She cannot yet confront the dire state of her selfesteem but she also cannot ignore it.
To appease both of these great psychic forces, her subconscious has crafted an encrypted message that Marianne can deliver unconsciously and that Connell can hopefully decipher and heed.
The message is <em>Help</em>.
<em>Help me recognize the abuse I’ve endured as abuse and as the true source of the bad feelings I have for myself.</em></p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Marianne cannot take the first step towards rehabilitating her selfesteem alone.
She needs a witness who will point at her abuse and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemic_injustice?oldformat=true#Hermeneutical_injustice">call it such</a>.
On some level, she knows she is a victim of abuse, but how can she trust herself if her own mother gaslights her about it?
It would take immense selfbelief to assert without anybody’s support that all her family members are traitorous liars that arbitrarily treat her like garbage.
How can she muster the strength to believe this when her experience in school seemed to confirm that she is indeed worthy of blind spite and scorn?
This is why Marianne needs Connell to say <em>Your family treats you horribly and it’s not your fault that they do.</em>
Recognizing the abuse as abuse is the first step towards believing that she is not bad.
Marianne cannot even begin the lengthy process of unlearning her feeling of worthlessness until she recognizes that <em>I am inherently bad</em> is a lie she tells herself to understand the abuse she endures as something other than abuse.
Until then, this lie keeps Marianne sane.
It gives a semblance of coherence to the paradox she cannot unwind.
Why does my family treat me so badly if they love me?</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Marianne’s choice of subjecting herself to the clutches of a sadist is an example of what psychotherapists call “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repetition_compulsion">acting out</a>” feelings.
It’s a puzzling concept that I find compelling.
Marianne has an unconscious need to process the awful trauma her family has inflicted on her, but she cannot find the psychological and emotional safety to do so consciously.
This tension finds release in her “acting out” her feelings by humiliating and degrading herself.
Marianne cannot yet identify her lack of selfesteem as caused by the cruelty and violence inflicted arbitarily on her by her family.
Instead, she locates the problem inside herself.
She figures there is a fundamental “coldness” that belongs to her and for which she is ultimately responsible.</p></div>

<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>Well, I don’t feel lovable. I think I have an unlovable sort of… I have a coldness about me. I’m difficult to like.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>To reflect this belief, Marianne routinely attaches to people that will make her feel bad about herself.
Jamie her sadistic boyfriend is not the first.
Nor is her toxic friend Peggy.
Before these was Connell.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Marianne’s relationship with Connell was founded on the basis that he is superior and that Marianne should content herself with his private attention even as he pretends not to know her in public.
Indeed, part of his magnetism is that he simultaneously affirms and dismisses Marianne’s feeling of inadequacy.
He gives and withdraws affection cyclically, allowing her to experience both assurance that she is lovable and confirmation that she is not.
All this is in the subtext until Marianne spells it out to him over coffee:</p></div>

<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>I didn’t need to play any games with you. It was real. With Jamie it’s like I’m acting a part, I just pretend to feel that way, like I’m in his power. But with you that really was the dynamic, I actually had those feelings, I would have done anything you wanted me to.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Marianne punctuates this point by asking:</p></div>

<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>Who wouldn’t want to beat me up?</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>And here we turn to Connell’s side of the equation, first by noticing that his response to this rhetorical question fails to reassure Marianne that she does not deserve to be beaten up.</p></div>

<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>I wouldn’t. Maybe I’m kind of unfashionable in that way.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Connell says he wouldn’t beat her up <em>because he’s not into that sort of thing</em>.
Significantly, he does not reject her statements of selfloathing.
Would it be too far to say he is agreeing with her by omission?
That his lack of response functions as a veiled agreement?</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Time and time again Connell has chosen not to address Marianne’s feelings of inadequacy.
Despite how humiliating Marianne’s position was in their secret relationship, Connell kept her there.
Again and again he chose not to rectify this disrespect.
And when circumstances threatened to reveal the truth, he betrayed and abandoned her.
And perhaps this choice genuinely sprang wholly from cowardice, from fear of public rebuke for dating Marianne.
But is there some part of Connell that enjoyed dominating Marianne?
There are certainly signs after they rekindle their romance in university.
For example, in response to sexual flattery from her, he laughes in delight and says:</p></div>

<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>Marianne, I’m not a religious person but I do sometimes think God made you for me.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Not <em>God made us for each other.</em>
No, <em>God made you for me.</em>
Awareness and desire for his superiority lives somewhere in Connell’s consciousness.
There is a moment when it bubbles up into his conscious mind and it frightens him.
When Marianne says she wouldn’t enjoy a threesome but would do it if Connell so desired, Connell becomes suddenly aware:</p></div>

<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>She comes to sit down with him and he touches her cheek. He has a terrible sense all of a sudden that he could hit her face, very hard even, and she would just sit there and let him. The idea frightens him so badly that he pulls his chair back and stands up. His hands are shaking. He doesn’t know why he thought about it. Maybe he wants to do it. But it makes him feel sick.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Where is this intrusive thought intruding from?
Is it a coincidence that this occurs to Connell, considering that repeatedly throughout their relationship he has failed to uplift her and thus, by omission, pushed her down?</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Sally Rooney gives us many hints that there is an unhealthiness in the couple’s dynamic.
For example, when Connell apologizes to Marianne for degrading her in high school, he adds that it “wouldn’t have mattered” if people had found out about their relationship because, it turns out, it wouldn’t have harmed his reputation anyway.
This struck me as an insensitive and insolent comment.
Connell should be apologizing that he didn’t have the courage to make their relationship public <em>even if</em> it would have made people think differently about him.
He should be apologizing for making Marianne pay in humiliation for his gross lack of integrity.
Marianne again fails to stand up for herself and instead of demanding that Connell recognize more fully what he did, she says <em>I didn’t tell anyone, I swear to god.</em></p></div>

<hr>

<div class="paragraph"><p><em>Normal People</em> implores us to examine the invisible reasoning behind our decision making.
If we tune in and listen to our silent thoughts, what might we hear?
What might we learn by noticing who we bring into our lives and what treatment we encourage and accept from them?
We like to think that who we are is up to us, but we already exist by the time we get around to the task of defining ourselves.
The primary task is to listen.
Observe.
What are the real motivations behind our actions?
Who are we, really?</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Good fiction offer us the means for answering these questions about ourselves by teaching us to answer the same questions about fictional characters.
A good story is a wealth of observations woven into narrative, that ancient and singularly powerful mode of thought and communication.
The world of literature is a mental arena where we can witness and experience things we will never see in life, a place of insight through simulation and observation.
A waking dream.
At its best, it is a birthing site of knowledge.
For literary critic <a href="https://youtu.be/Uy8dL9QZ1lk?si=kWdI1VwvPgmYv-go">Harold Bloom</a>, Shakespeare’s works form the pinnacle of this experience:</p></div>
<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>When you really have a deep relationship to [Shakespeare’s] works, then you change. You start, indeed like Shakespearean characters, overhearing yourself.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I had severe allergies until the early evening.
This happens to me whenever I travel somewhere new.
In 2017 I went to Europe for the first time and I spent the first full day sneezing and oozing.
Same thing this time in Tokyo for the first 24 hours.
Reactine didn’t seem to make a difference, just had to wait it out.</p></div>

  <li>explored the rest of the park, rode on more rides, fought jetlag</li>
  <li>left @ 9pm, closing time</li>
</ul>

<div class="paragraph"><p>The architecture and spatial planning of the theme park was really impressive.
It seemed like every corner we rounded we encountered another stridebreaking view of the park.
It reminded me of the architectural tactic of constraining the height and width of hallways to reinforce the impact of emerging into a bigger space.
It’s a method that’s been employed by Tadao Ando of Osaka and other famous architects like Frank Lloyd Wright.</p></div>

</ul>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Tokyo station was huge and very busy.
It felt like being in a beehive.
It took me and Z a while to figure out how to pick up our tickets.
One machine gave us an error message but then we tried a machine in a different section and it worked.
Then we circled through the masses, trying to figure out which screen listed our train’s platform.
When we finally found it, we struggled to pass through the gate.
Z put in the two tickets as the ticket machine had instructed but that wasn’t enough.
We had a confusing interaction with a worker there, who we finally understood was saying to scan our IC card after inserting the tickets.
We made it through and with thirty minutes left until departure time, we lined up to buy food and drinks to take onto the train.
It’s good we came an hour early.</p></div>

  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">

    <div class="paragraph"><p>In her novel <em>Normal People</em>, Sally Rooney exposes the hidden reasoning of our subconscious.
<!--more-->
She does so primarily by translating into clear words the opaque subconscious reasoning of both her protagonists, Connell and Marianne.
If they were real people, these characters would experience their thoughts not as Rooney’s sentences but as intuitive feelings and inarticulate notions.
But we as readers get privileged access to their thoughts and feelings through the backdoor entrance of Rooney’s prose.
This special access has two major effects.
One, we understand these characters intimately.
In a way perhaps that they would not understand themselves.
And two, we are reminded that we also experience internally an unending stream of unrefined thought.
We too are partially in the dark about our intentions and motivations.
That this level of semiconscious thought exists and that our understanding of it can be sharpened through introspection and articulation are useful observations Rooney offers us.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Another way that Rooney puts unconscious reasoning on display in her book is by having her characters make choices that seem unmotivated or arbitrary, but prove meaningful in effect.
Following are two examples of this, one minor and one major.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>A minor example is when Connell and his mother Lorraine give Marianne a ride home from the grocery store.
Connell chooses to drop his mother off first.
Is it a coincidence that this gives him some private time with Marianne?
Lorraine begins collecting the groceries to take them inside, but Connell stops her and says he will do it later.
This seems at first an odd detail for the author to include.
But its purpose becomes clear when Connell declines Marianne’s invitation to come in for tea.
<em>Oh, I would, but there’s ice cream in the boot.</em>
Rooney is showing us that this was a calculated decision.
Connell contrived the situation to contain a convenient excuse.
What isn’t clear is whether Connell is fully conscious of his calculations.
It seems like the kind of decision he might recognize only in retrospect as deliberate.
And until he does, until he admits to himself that only some of his decisions are made in full consciousness, he cannot be fully selfaware.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>A similar but more major example is Marianne’s choice to tell Connell that her new boyfriend Jamie is a sadist.
On the surface, this is a bizarre choice.
Why confess this, unprompted, to an ex-boyfriend?
Is she being cruel, trying to make Connell jealous?
When Connell reacts with alarm, Marianne plays it off with a “cute little smile.”
Nonchalantly, she continues.
<em>[He] likes to beat me up. Just during sex, that is. Not during arguments.</em>
Marianne’s behavior seems odd and clumnsy, but it’s not.
She has invited Connell for coffee to tell him – the same person to whom she confided about being physically abused by her father – that her new boyfriend beats her up during sex.
She is crying for help.
Or at least for some sort of attention.
But is she doing this with awareness?
Is her casual tone a mask to hide her feelings from Connell?
Or is she concealing them from herself as well?
Her amusement is likely a real feeling encasing the truer feelings of desperation and selfloathing.
This enigmatic form of communication reflects the contradiction inside Marianne.
She cannot yet confront the dire state of her selfesteem but she also cannot ignore it.
To appease both of these great psychic forces, her subconscious has crafted an encrypted message that Marianne can deliver unconsciously and that Connell can hopefully decipher and heed.
The message is <em>Help</em>.
<em>Help me recognize the abuse I’ve endured as abuse and as the true source of the bad feelings I have for myself.</em></p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Marianne cannot take the first step towards rehabilitating her selfesteem alone.
She needs a witness who will point at her abuse and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemic_injustice?oldformat=true#Hermeneutical_injustice">call it such</a>.
On some level, she knows she is a victim of abuse, but how can she trust herself if her own mother gaslights her about it?
It would take immense selfbelief to assert without anybody’s support that all her family members are traitorous liars that arbitrarily treat her like garbage.
How can she muster the strength to believe this when her experience in school seemed to confirm that she is indeed worthy of blind spite and scorn?
This is why Marianne needs Connell to say <em>Your family treats you horribly and it’s not your fault that they do.</em>
Recognizing the abuse as abuse is the first step towards believing that she is not bad.
Marianne cannot even begin the lengthy process of unlearning her feeling of worthlessness until she recognizes that <em>I am inherently bad</em> is a lie she tells herself to understand the abuse she endures as something other than abuse.
Until then, this lie keeps Marianne sane.
It gives a semblance of coherence to the paradox she cannot unwind.
Why does my family treat me so badly if they love me?</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Marianne’s choice of subjecting herself to the clutches of a sadist is an example of what psychotherapists call “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repetition_compulsion">acting out</a>” feelings.
It’s a puzzling concept that I find compelling.
Marianne has an unconscious need to process the awful trauma her family has inflicted on her, but she cannot find the psychological and emotional safety to do so consciously.
This tension finds release in her “acting out” her feelings by humiliating and degrading herself.
Marianne cannot yet identify her lack of selfesteem as caused by the cruelty and violence inflicted arbitarily on her by her family.
Instead, she locates the problem inside herself.
She figures there is a fundamental “coldness” that belongs to her and for which she is ultimately responsible.</p></div>

<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>Well, I don’t feel lovable. I think I have an unlovable sort of… I have a coldness about me. I’m difficult to like.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>To reflect this belief, Marianne routinely attaches to people that will make her feel bad about herself.
Jamie her sadistic boyfriend is not the first.
Nor is her toxic friend Peggy.
Before these was Connell.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Marianne’s relationship with Connell was founded on the basis that he is superior and that Marianne should content herself with his private attention even as he pretends not to know her in public.
Indeed, part of his magnetism is that he simultaneously affirms and dismisses Marianne’s feeling of inadequacy.
He gives and withdraws affection cyclically, allowing her to experience both assurance that she is lovable and confirmation that she is not.
All this is in the subtext until Marianne spells it out to him over coffee:</p></div>

<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>I didn’t need to play any games with you. It was real. With Jamie it’s like I’m acting a part, I just pretend to feel that way, like I’m in his power. But with you that really was the dynamic, I actually had those feelings, I would have done anything you wanted me to.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Marianne punctuates this point by asking:</p></div>

<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>Who wouldn’t want to beat me up?</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>And here we turn to Connell’s side of the equation, first by noticing that his response to this rhetorical question fails to reassure Marianne that she does not deserve to be beaten up.</p></div>

<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>I wouldn’t. Maybe I’m kind of unfashionable in that way.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Connell says he wouldn’t beat her up <em>because he’s not into that sort of thing</em>.
Significantly, he does not reject her statements of selfloathing.
Would it be too far to say he is agreeing with her by omission?
That his lack of response functions as a veiled agreement?</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Time and time again Connell has chosen not to address Marianne’s feelings of inadequacy.
Despite how humiliating Marianne’s position was in their secret relationship, Connell kept her there.
Again and again he chose not to rectify this disrespect.
And when circumstances threatened to reveal the truth, he betrayed and abandoned her.
And perhaps this choice genuinely sprang wholly from cowardice, from fear of public rebuke for dating Marianne.
But is there some part of Connell that enjoyed dominating Marianne?
There are certainly signs after they rekindle their romance in university.
For example, in response to sexual flattery from her, he laughes in delight and says:</p></div>

<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>Marianne, I’m not a religious person but I do sometimes think God made you for me.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Not <em>God made us for each other.</em>
No, <em>God made you for me.</em>
Awareness and desire for his superiority lives somewhere in Connell’s consciousness.
There is a moment when it bubbles up into his conscious mind and it frightens him.
When Marianne says she wouldn’t enjoy a threesome but would do it if Connell so desired, Connell becomes suddenly aware:</p></div>

<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>She comes to sit down with him and he touches her cheek. He has a terrible sense all of a sudden that he could hit her face, very hard even, and she would just sit there and let him. The idea frightens him so badly that he pulls his chair back and stands up. His hands are shaking. He doesn’t know why he thought about it. Maybe he wants to do it. But it makes him feel sick.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Where is this intrusive thought intruding from?
Is it a coincidence that this occurs to Connell, considering that repeatedly throughout their relationship he has failed to uplift her and thus, by omission, pushed her down?</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Sally Rooney gives us many hints that there is an unhealthiness in the couple’s dynamic.
For example, when Connell apologizes to Marianne for degrading her in high school, he adds that it “wouldn’t have mattered” if people had found out about their relationship because, it turns out, it wouldn’t have harmed his reputation anyway.
This struck me as an insensitive and insolent comment.
Connell should be apologizing that he didn’t have the courage to make their relationship public <em>even if</em> it would have made people think differently about him.
He should be apologizing for making Marianne pay in humiliation for his gross lack of integrity.
Marianne again fails to stand up for herself and instead of demanding that Connell recognize more fully what he did, she says <em>I didn’t tell anyone, I swear to god.</em></p></div>

<hr>

<div class="paragraph"><p><em>Normal People</em> implores us to examine the invisible reasoning behind our decision making.
If we tune in and listen to our silent thoughts, what might we hear?
What might we learn by noticing who we bring into our lives and what treatment we encourage and accept from them?
We like to think that who we are is up to us, but we already exist by the time we get around to the task of defining ourselves.
The primary task is to listen.
Observe.
What are the real motivations behind our actions?
Who are we, really?</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Good fiction offer us the means for answering these questions about ourselves by teaching us to answer the same questions about fictional characters.
A good story is a wealth of observations woven into narrative, that ancient and singularly powerful mode of thought and communication.
The world of literature is a mental arena where we can witness and experience things we will never see in life, a place of insight through simulation and observation.
A waking dream.
At its best, it is a birthing site of knowledge.
For literary critic <a href="https://youtu.be/Uy8dL9QZ1lk?si=kWdI1VwvPgmYv-go">Harold Bloom</a>, Shakespeare’s works form the pinnacle of this experience:</p></div>
<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>When you really have a deep relationship to [Shakespeare’s] works, then you change. You start, indeed like Shakespearean characters, overhearing yourself.</p></div>

    <div class="paragraph"><p>Museums underwhelm me.
<!--more-->
The task of trudging around a vast building looking at a bunch of items seems like lazily assigned homework, especially at big museums.
I need a lot more context.
One paragraph per gallery is not enough, nor is a little tag telling me what each item is or was.
Perhaps I need to start booking tours at every museum I go to.
I would feel much more engaged if I could ask questions or otherwise felt like I was <em>understanding</em> something.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>At Tokyo National Museum, the exhibit I most enjoyed was the archaelogical one.
It sketched the ancient history of Japan in twelves paragraphs arranged in chronological order around a big room full of ceramic pots and other ancient items that have been uncovered in the region.
Most of my attention was absorbed by the information and only a little bit was given to the artifacts themselves.
Remains of archaic civilizations are interesting, but they don’t make my imagination run wild.
I need something to engage with mentally.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Before we went into the archaelogical exhibit, I spent most of the time on my phone.
Not distracting myself, but pouring mental energy into reading people’s opinions on Reddit regarding whether <em>Infinite Jest</em> was worth reading.
It was fun.
It made me think.
I also spent some time grumpily mulling over why I felt disinterested in the museum.
<em>Should I</em> find this format engaging?
Room after room of items displayed behind glass through which I was supposed to peer studiously and silently for a few seconds?
And when I was finished, what coherent impression was I supposed to have cobbled from eyeing an assortment of tools and trinkets presented to me with minimal context?</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I found myself speculating on the origin of museums themselves.
Who made this format up?
The history of things often reveals obscure and obsolete reasons behind their particularities.
City planning and land zoning in America, for example, seem arbitrary and incompetently devised until you understand the cultural context they developed from.
Certain rules and norms start making a lot more sense when you understand that many American cities followed the example set by New York and that New York’s infrastructure developed to accommodate white families living in the suburbs while working in the city.
In that light, we start to see the murky reasons why transit infrastructure in American cities caters to cars first and why single family residential zoning is so common in North America.
It is only due to the ongoing housing crises that American and Canadian cities have begun to loosen restrictions to allow buildings with multiple dwellings in these areas.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>We must resist the impulse of assuming norms and <a href="/vbook/tags/rules">rules</a> must make sense.
Things are shaped by their history, and it is the material conditions of a particular place and time that set the mold.
When the reasoning underpinning a design is not evident, and when the design seems counterproductive, there is probably a very good historical reason for it.
A very good reason for why it <em>happened</em>, that is, not for why it should still be.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I suspect there are very good reasons discoverable in the history of museums to explain why they are the way they are.
Whatever the reasons, they are not evident to me now, and I suspect they are obsolete.
I can imagine European aristocrats centuries ago oohing and ahhing at exotic artifacts taken from faraway worlds and imagining the fascinating “primitive” lives to which they belonged.
Perhaps for these folks simply gazing at objects plucked from the cultures that gave them their meaning was a thrill and a half, and perhaps it would be for me as well if I didn’t have access to computers, the internet, and international travel.
Perhaps if I lived back then, in their context, I would also covet these same artifacts as trophies, as precious symbols of my status in the world.
In that case I would make sure to keep it safe, still showing it off, yes, but from the safety of a glass box, alongside the rest of my collection.</p></div>

<p>Learning to pick between </p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/work"><em>productive</em> and <em>absorptive</em></a><p> activities based on my current mood and energy level has helped me notice, for example, when I should try to write instead of reading.
<!--more--></p>
</div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>← productive                                                                                                                                 absorptive →</p></div>

<hr>

<div class="paragraph"><p>It occurred to me recently that there are many other dimensions to consider when picking an activity.
An obvious distinction is <em>active</em> vs <em>passive</em> activities.
It is similar to <em>productive</em> vs <em>absorptive</em>, but it’s possible to be absorptive both actively (e.g. reading) and passively (e.g. watching, listening).</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>← active                                                                                                                                               passive →</p></div>

<hr>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Are you in a mood to expend energy or do you need to refuel?
The same answer will have different implications for different people.
For introverted people, having “expensive” capacity at a given moment offers an opportunity to socialize.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>← expensive                                                                                                                               regenerative →</p></div>

<hr>

<div class="paragraph"><p>After determining that you want to watch a movie – a fine choice when one is feeling passive-absorptive-regenerative – you can figure out whether you want to do your passive absorbing alone or with other people.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>← individual                                                                                                                                             social →</p></div>

<hr>

<div class="paragraph"><p>While going through this exercise, you don’t have to pick a point on each spectrum.
I think it’s unlikely you’ll have answers for all.
(Ah yes, I’m feeling productive-active-social-regenerative, that’s the word I was looking for!)
But with every choice, you filter down many possible activities into the ones best suited to your current mood.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Are you in a social-regenerative mood?
Meet with friends to do something that nourishes you.
Or are you feeling social-expensive?
Do something that you’re not easily motivated to do but that your loved ones want to do with you.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I always try to choose activities based on how I’m feeling so I can evade the taxing experience of forcing myself to do something through willpower alone.
But you can’t always wait for the right mood to come.
In life, you have to do some planning, and you can do that better if you learn how your moods and energy levels fluctuate.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Notice which activities are expensive for you.
Make time after those for your regenerative activites.
Whether you’re more introverted or extroverted, take note of how often you need social interaction to keep a healthy balance.
Whether you’re a morning person or a night owl, dedicate your expensive mood to </p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/work-2">meaningful, important work</a><p>.
If producing is important to you, dedicate time to absorbing as well.

That certainly makes me feel better about socializing aimlessly in the evening, when I feel like I’ve done something productive with my day.</p></div>

<ul>
  <li>solo coffee &amp; journaling @ City Bakery</li>
  <li>teppanyaki dinner w/ my mom on top floor of mall in Ginza</li>
  <li>visit the teamLAB Borderless Digital Art Museum</li>
</ul>

<div class="paragraph"><p>The Digital Art Museum was really cool.
It was a dark maze on the bottom floor of a fancy mall where myriad projectors shone moving patterns and images of light on walls, floors, and ceilings.
This by itself might’ve been a gimmicky socialmedia tourist trap, but embedded throughout the large labyrinthine gallery were rooms where sculptural elements combined with light, music, and mirrors to create surreal experiences.</p></div>

<ul>
  <li>check out but leave bags at hotel</li>
  <li>solo cortado from Brooklyn Roasters in Ginza</li>
  <li>solo browse flea market &amp; buy orange tinted glass to use for cappuccinos at home</li>
  <li>pick up bags at hotel and take train to Narita</li>
  <li>flew directly @ 6pm from Tokyo (NRT) -&gt; Vancouver (YVR)</li>
</ul>

<div class="paragraph"><p>My intention was to browse Hands and Itoya in Ginza, but I came across the flea market when I stopped for coffee by Ginza station.
There were dozens of stalls selling ceramics, porcelain, kimonos, jackets, bluedyed fabrics, and so on.
The orange tinted glass I bought was only 400 yen, less than three dollars in USD, and I could see it selling for tens times the amount at trendy stores in the USA and Canada.
I’m still sour about going to the East Vancouver “Flea Market” to find they charge an <em>admission fee</em> and sell priced up secondhand and vintagestyled clothing.</p></div>
