Like when you set your glass down too hard and the wave rises to the rim menacingly.
<!--more-->
I took a deep breath and I wrote the things down – things I had to do at work, things I had to do for my upcoming marriage, and things I had to do to enjoy Toronto, where I am for the week.
Each of these categories overflows with things I could do, as I guess any category does.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I wrote only a few things per category and recognized immediately that this was the whole day ahead of me.
If I completed everything on the list, I would have good reason to be pleased.
And yet there was so little on it.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I recoil with something like disgust when I look at my day on paper.
That’s it?
These things?
So I avoid writing down my daily activities, even if I know what I intend to do.
I proceed jauntily as if my day were big enough to contain all its possibilities, the million different days it could be.
But I know it’s only one day, which is but one measly little trickle mocking my thirst for experience and accomplishment.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>But I suspect that this exercise, like other painful ones, offers the opportunity to grow.
Write the list and look at it.
What is so ugly about it?
Is it these particular activities?
Do you wish you weren’t spending your life doing them?
This is an answer to know and confront.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>But if these activities are good, if they satisfy your expectations of life-worthy activities, then why don’t they satisfy you?
Is their ugliness your own mortality being reflected back at you?

    <div class="paragraph"><p>It is old advice to live now because now is the only time you will ever live.
Embrace this moment because it is the only one in reach.

But the advice resonates only so deeply with me.
I find many nows made for trading, worthy of giving up for what I can get later.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>To this cliche </p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/four-thousand-weeks">Oliver Burkeman</a><p> adds a darker harmony with a note of his own.
You will never make the most of your time.
It is painfully short and any bid for optimal use of it is doomed.
Suddenly the original cliche is not about changing your attitude but about accepting that you get what you get.
The task is not about settling, but about admitting defeat.
Time rules you and the freest you can get is by giving up the fight.</p>
