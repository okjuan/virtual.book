<!--more-->
They want printed proof of the inspection so they can get on their way but Amir doesn’t want to give them anything with his shop’s name.</p></div>

<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>I fail inspections and then people give me bad reviews on Google. All the dealerships in this area hate me! That car right there is from the dealership. I drive it around and when it gets hot, it goes b-b-boom. They tell me, come on, just pass it. They tell me no, no, no, I say no, no, no.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>The two guys nod politely.</p></div>

<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>A guy brought me a car that passed an inspection and I failed it! I called the guy and told him he’s lucky he brought it to me! I told him this, this, this, and you are lucky because they would take your license away. And he said oh thank you, thank you so much. Next day I see a bad review on Google. Ah you think I don’t know what that is?</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>More silent nodding.</p></div>

<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>Because of my job, I have to be honest! If I pass the inspection, peoples lives depend on it, and they take the car out and – boom! They tell me to pass the inspection, but I have to be honest, I don’t care.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I want to ask him whether he’s watched Seinfeld and tell him about the episode where Jerry agonizes over falling out with his mechanic, the only honest mechanic in New York.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>When I’m up at the counter paying, I see a sign on the wall that says his shop has been “serving the community since 1997.”
I tell him I was one year old then.</p></div>

<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>You were one year old? Now you are a man! And back then, I was like you! Now! I am old!</p></div>
