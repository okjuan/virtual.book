    <div class="paragraph"><p>Decades ago, The New Yorker and other magazines experimented with the journalistic form by introducing literary techniques into it.
<!--more-->
Writers aspired not just to document scenes but to recreate them for readers to witness.
Though some writers criticized this practice for warping truth through interpretation, other writers flourished in it.
Tom Wolfe, a practitioner and evangelist of the method, compiled exemplary articles in his book <em>The New Journalism</em>.
According to Wolfe, using techniques of literary realism was like <a id="2022-06-11-show-instead-of-telling" class="" href="/vbook/show-instead-of-telling">adding electricity</a> into the otherwise mechanical machine of journalism.
By using dialogue, <a id="2023-06-30-narrate-transparently" class="" href="/vbook/narrate-transparently">point of view</a>, and symbolism, writers could achieve “absolute involvement of the reader”.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>The anthology includes a passage from Hunter S.
Thompson’s <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Non-fiction_novel">nonfiction novel</a> on the Hell’s Angels, which he wrote after a year of living with them.
Thompson depicts a tense confrontation between the Angels and the locals of Bass Lake, the gang’s preferred destination for their Labor Day tradition of binge-drinking and mayhem-making.</p></div>

<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>“If you play straight with us, Sonny, we’ll play straight with you.
We don’t want any trouble and we know you guys have as much right to camp on this lake as anybody else.
But the minute you cause trouble for us or anyone else, we’re gonna come down on you hard, it’s gonna be powder valley for your whole gang.”</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>On the day, Thompson’s newspaper editor requested “no more than an arty variation of the standard wire-service news blurb: Who, What, When, Where, and Why.” But in his book Thompson gives us much more.
He doesn’t report the events in the cold, detached voice of the typical journalist observing from the sidelines.
Nor does he simply list the facts and state the outcome.
He recounts, in first person, the experience of being caught in a stand-off between outlaws known for their brutality and a makeshift militia of locals determined to defend their town:</p></div>

<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>“The first one of these sonsofbitches that gives me any lip I’m gonna shoot right in the belly.
That’s the only language they understand.”</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>The reader leaves not with memorizable facts, but a secondhand experience based on Thompson’s point of view:</p></div>

<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>I was standing in the midst of about a hundred vigilantes…as I looked around I saw that many carried wooden clubs and others had hunting knives on their belts.
They didn’t seem mean, but they were obviously keyed up and ready to bust some heads…under these circumstances the only neutrals were the tourists, who were easily identifiable.
On my way out of town I wondered if anybody in Bass Lake might take one of my aspen-leaf checks for a fluorescent Hawaiian beach suit and some stylish sandals.</p></div>

He roams America in his RV interviewing the country’s kookiest characters and recording their antics.
Like Thompson, Callaghan throws himself into the action.
With false innocence, he encourages his subjects to rant and reveal their quirks and delusions.
In <a href="https://youtu.be/6tuYIXi6nTQ">Return to Tallega</a>, Callaghan shows the unhinged debauchery of beer-soaked racing festivals of the American South much like Thompson did with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Kentucky_Derby_Is_Decadent_and_Depraved">The Kentucky Derby is Decadent and Depraved</a>.

  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">

    <div class="paragraph"><p>As satisfying as it was to hear Herbie narrate the <a id="2022-06-11-reinvent-yourself" class="" href="/vbook/reinvent-yourself">stories in his audiobook</a>, it was frustrating to never hear his music.
<!--more-->
Music snippets would’ve expressed much more than descriptions like “gorgeous house of sound” and “river of gorgeous sound”.
Instead of working with a ghostwriter to write a book, perhaps Herbie should’ve collaborated with Ken Burns, creator of the Jazz documentary series, to create something more.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>To tell the story of jazz music, Burns uses images and sound: narration, interviews, photos, videos, and music.
The documentary series looks like a great PowerPoint slideshow.
It’s not flashy, but it’s illuminating.
The narrator doesn’t have to shower us with adjectives for us to imagine the scene because we can hear it in the music and see it in the photographs.
Words tell us what is true, but our senses convince us of it.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>In the introduction to his new book, <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/237957/our-america-by-ken-burns/">Our America</a>, Ken Burns writes:</p></div>

<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>I don’t just look at the photograph…I <strong>listen</strong> to it, as well.
Are the troops tramping, the cannons firing, the leaves rustling? Is the bat cracking, the crowd cheering?…it has been my essential responsibility in every film I’ve made to try to animate that moment, to bring it alive.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Like Burns, YouTube video essayists offer us raw material instead of flattening it into words.
Thomas Flight’s <em>Why Are David Lynch Movies Like That?</em> is dense with samples of Lynch’s works, and much better for it.
His description of Lynch’s worst work as “still [radiating] a unique quality” would be abstract, unclear, if it weren’t spoken over clips from Dune.
Dubbing audio over video is so common on YouTube that it’s easy to overlook how well it works.
Imagine <a href="https://youtu.be/tvHRUY0tBcs">What Song Are You Listening To?</a> videos without the song snippets: suddenly it would be as awkward to watch as it probably was to record.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Like authors, journalists and essayists insist on writing things the reader needs to see or hear.
Pieces like <em>The New Yorker</em>’s <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/02/28/florine-stettheimer-artist-book-review-barbara-bloemink">recent one</a> on painter Florine Stettheimer lack samples of the visual art they talk about, leaving the reader to collect descriptions of the painter’s style — “feathery, ornamental…faux-naïf, fluorescent” — and try to hold them, as they spill out of mind like water out of cupped hands, until they can look up her paintings.
Why work so hard? Is this the writer’s job or the reader’s? The piece leaves a faint impression compared to <em>Affairs of the Art</em>, a short film available on <em>The New Yorker</em>’s YouTube channel: a shiver-inducing yet hilarious piece that combines writing, narration, drawings, sound effects, and music.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>This is <a id="2023-03-09-justify-writing" class="" href="/vbook/justify-writing">not</a> to say we abandon writing.
But can we compensate for its weaknesses by <a id="2022-06-11-show-instead-of-telling" class="" href="/vbook/show-instead-of-telling">exploring other formats</a>?</p></div>

    </div></div><p> as it has <a href="https://pudding.cool/">The Pudding</a>: a digital publication specializing in ‘visual essays’ developed by ‘Journalist-Engineers’ that write both prose and source code to create their articles.
Their piece <a href="https://pudding.cool/2017/03/music-history/"><em>How Music Taste Evolved</em></a>, more app than article, lets the user click through pop music history to hear snippets of songs that topped the charts from 1958 until 2016.
Instead of forcing you to read about the contrast between the swaying, dreamy sound of <a href="https://youtu.be/57tK6aQS_H0">Smoke Gets In Your Eyes</a> and the youthful pep of <a href="https://youtu.be/FCPutYaGFlE">Stagger Lee</a>, it lets you hear it.
And if you’re not interested in pop music from early 1959, then you can leap forward to whatever decade interests you.
The involvement of the reader is literal.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>As refreshing as it is, the piece is far from fulfilling its potential.
The first improvement is obvious: automatically update every day with the newest song at the top the charts.
(The equivalent for printed books, publishing new editions, is pathetic in comparison.) The piece could take its interactivity to the next level by letting you save songs to your music library or dive into specific artists by linking to their Wikipedia articles, which also update with new information and themselves lead to other articles.
Or it could browse the internet on your behalf to find live performances and interesting articles, showing new things every time you visit.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Using technology, we can bring information alive and make our interactions with it more meaningful.
As Michael Scott puts it:</p></div>

<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>You don’t go to the science museum and get handed a pamphlet on electricity…you put your hand on a metal ball and your hair sticks up straight.
And you know science.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>The benefit of combining mediums is clearest in education, where you want to build both analytical and intuitive understanding.
A musician trying to teach music theory should think twice about writing a traditional book.
Alongside their theoretical explanations, they could offer an interface that lets the user add notes to a music staff and hear what they sound like; or listens to the user play their instrument and transcribes it in real time.
A writer passionate about Hemingway’s writing principles and bent on teaching them may feel the urge to write a book; and, although it would educate aspiring writers, it would lack the interactive experience offered by <a href="https://hemingwayapp.com/">Hemingway App</a>, which shows a writer in real time what rules they are breaching.
(To what extent the rules can be codified is a <a href="https://www.litcharts.com/blog/analitics/what-makes-hemingway/">different question</a>.)</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>As one of the architects responsible for the daring design of the Seattle Central Library <a href="https://youtu.be/1x0PA0Rnjho">said</a>:</p></div>

<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>Books are technology; that’s something people forget.
But it’s a form of technology that will have to share its dominance with any other form of truly potent technology or media.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>What if a memoirist publishes a piece overlaid with their revisions to show the process of expression and expose the artifice of memoir?
Or what if an English professor does the same to compare writing styles and the emotions they convey?
What if a novelist publishes a first-person novel in real time to make it feel like the character really exists and is experiencing events alongside the reader?
What if the author then goes back and rewrites previous parts of the novel to show the decay of memory and its corruption in the construction of personal narratives?</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Long before the birth of the digital world, writers like Hunter S. Thompson breached conventional forms to create new experiences for readers.
And writers can continue to experiment within the book-bound format without intervention from outer disciplines.
But they could also work with designers and engineers to create literature’s equivalent to musical technology like synthesizers and drum machines — the tools that Herbie Hancock used to </p><a class='hover-link'  href="/vbook/reinvent-yourself">reinvent his art</a><div class='hover-card-container'><div class='hover-card'>

    <div class="paragraph"><p>The first song of Herbie Hancock’s <em>Mwandishi</em> is hard to describe.
<!--more-->
It eases in with watery synths and a muted trumpet, then a jagged riff played simultaneously on bass guitar and bass clarinet.
The repetition of the riff becomes our steadying grip as the pace quickens and more instruments enter the flurry, each swirling in its own direction.
For thirteen minutes, we follow Herbie and his crew as they chase the thrill of charting new territory.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Navigating Herbie’s diverse discography is just as difficult.
A musical genius with a tinkering habit, Herbie composed jazz standards like <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/0sCeNwt8xRCMR4NhKpMyBe?si=16f0f4368bd24909"><em>Cantaloupe Island</em></a> in the 60s, made <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/4Ce66JznW8QbeyTdSzdGwR?si=344c6dba0713440b">funk classics</a> in the 70s, and brought <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/2nWHzbBWBOePUvAImQv2So?si=a598e86bedcb4510">DJ scratching</a> into the mainstream in the 80s.
Often he’d <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/22pgLNVqrtA3R0NTAf6zlx?si=6c703d66b0844175">reinterpret his old compositions</a> using whatever new sounds he was experimenting with.
The new millennium still did not slow Herbie.
In 2008, he took home the Grammy for Album of the Year for a <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/7M0Od3nNXEdZ58O5FYNVvG?si=ceb4768ceeb54c10">tribute</a> to singer-songwriter Joni Mitchell.
Now in his 80s, he tours the world playing his music.
Spanning decades and genres, Herbie’s career almost makes more sense as the work of Herbie Hancock, Herbie Hancock Jr, and Herbie Hancock III.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>In <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20821012-herbie-hancock">his memoir</a>, <em>Possibilities</em> (2014), Herbie tells the stories that spurred his musical digressions.
In the late 60s and early 70s, at a time when Herbie and his band engaged with Black Nationalist ideas of self-discovery and self-determination, Herbie’s music was spontaneous and experimental.
Each band member adopted a Swahili name.
Herbie became <em>Mwandishi</em>, meaning ‘composer’ or ‘writer’.
The group improvised freely, unconcerned with reaching a wide audience.
At their peak, their performances were spiritual experiences for the band and the small, captivated crowd.</p></div>

<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>It felt like the music was playing us, coming down from somewhere above, and we were just the vessels…everything my fingers played was connecting perfectly to everything [they were] playing.
As we got deeper into the music we became one big, pulsating creature…</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>One day, after a rare night of partying through sunrise with his bandmates, a sleep-deprived Herbie could not muster the energy to start the show.
He figured Buster Williams — AKA <em>Mchezaji</em>, ‘skilled player’— could ease them in with the bass; but then the intro became a 10-minute solo that jerked the band awake.
By the end of the night, audience members had tears in their eyes.
Herbie demanded an explanation from his bassist, and the answer would change his life: <em>Nichiren Buddhism</em>.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>The couple hours that the band had spent sleeping before the show Williams had spent chanting <em>Namu Myōhō Renge Kyō</em>, a Buddhist meditation aiming to “fuse your life with the mystic law of cause and effect through sound.” Until now, Herbie had only found spiritual philosophies preaching esoteric ideas, demanding blind faith, and promising little until the afterlife.
Buddhism offered a simple practice to empower him as a musician in this world.
So Herbie did what Herbie does: he experimented.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>As Herbie delved deeper into Buddhist practice and <em>Mwandishi</em> came to a natural end, he discovered a desire to connect to a broader audience.
He nurtured inspiration from The Pointer Sisters and Sly &amp; the Family Stone, resisting the “musical elitism” that would have him look down on funk music.
In 1973, months after releasing his last <em>Mwandishi</em> record, Herbie released the groove-riddled <em>Head Hunters</em> debut album, one of the best-selling jazz albums of all time.
<em>Actual Proof</em>, a song from the second Headhunters album, is named after Nichiren Buddhism’s promise to benefit one’s earthly life.</p></div>
