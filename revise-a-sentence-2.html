    <div class="paragraph"><p>Take this quote by anthropologist Clifford Geertz:</p></div>
<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>One of the most significant facts about humanity may finally be that we all begin with the natural equipment to live a thousand kinds of life but end in the end having lived only one.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<!--more-->

<div class="paragraph"><p>A lovely little idea weighed down by free-loading filler words.
First of all, the preamble is unnecessary.
<strong>We all</strong> alone indicates we are talking about humans.
And let us decide how significant your fact is.
Don’t be so insecure (or arrogant).</p></div>

<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p><del>One of the most significant facts about humanity may finally be that</del> We all begin with the natural equipment to live a thousand kinds of life but end in the end having lived only one.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>How good is a sentence if decapitation improves it?</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>The other necessary change is screamingly obvious.
We <strong>end in the end</strong>?
Sure, but only after we have begun in the beginning.
(Was he trying to reach a word count? Or distract a doorman while someone snuck in?)</p></div>

<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>We all begin with the natural equipment to live a thousand kinds of life but <del>end</del> in the end <del>having lived</del> live only one.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>For our troubles, we get a free upgrade from <strong>having lived</strong> to <strong>live</strong>.
Free the verb to be a verb.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>We’ve chopped our way down to the meat of the sentence.
Is there any fat to trim?</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Is <strong>We all</strong> better than <strong>We</strong>?</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>How much better is <strong>kinds of life</strong> than <strong>lives</strong> that it deserves three times the space?
Sentence space is precious.
Raise the rent.</p></div>

<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>We <del>all</del> begin with the natural equipment to live a thousand <del>kinds of life</del> lives but in the end <del>having lived</del> live only one.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Can we prune more?
Riding the high of halving the original, it’s tempting to cut out <strong>in the end</strong>.</p></div>

<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>We begin with the natural equipment to live a thousand lives but <del>in the end</del> live only one.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>But <strong>in the end</strong> is contributing.
It invokes the passage of time by drawing a line from <strong>begin</strong>.
It draws the arc of a single life lived.
Tracing this line we sense the transformation of many possibilities into one reality.
We also sense the briefness of this single life now that the sentence is briefer.</p></div>

<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>We begin with the natural equipment to live a thousand lives but in the end live only one.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>There are several words here doing a job.
<strong>Natural equipment</strong> means bodily and mental potential, while <strong>equipment</strong> alone would mean material tools like hammers and textbooks.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>The <strong>the</strong> in front of <strong>natural equipment</strong> is one of those pesky ones.
It’s like a plain, mild-mannered friend that you think you can exclude from the group but without whom things are somehow less comfortable.</p></div>

<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>We begin with <del>the</del> natural equipment to live a thousand lives but in the end live only one.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>When we scrutinize words like this, when we interrogate them, we learn what each of them is doing.
This allows us not only to eliminate useless words but to replace imprecise ones.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Is <strong>a thousand lives</strong> enough?
Should we multiply it with itself to raise the stakes?</p></div>

<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>We begin with the natural equipment to live a million lives but in the end live only one.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Hmm.
Now it feels too… flippant?
And somehow… overstated?</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>A <strong>thousand lives</strong> has the modesty that lacked in the original sentence’s preamble.
It sticks the landing without too extravagant a flourish.</p></div>

<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>We begin with the natural equipment to live a thousand lives but in the end live only one.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Much better.
Ok, next sentence.</p></div>
