<h3 id="interior-design">interior design</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>An odd perk of splitting my time between Seattle and Vancouver has been furnishing and decorating a second apartment, a task for which I have enough gusto to do twice over.
More than twice, actually.
I’ve starting telling friends that I would gladly help them lay out their spaces.
I told one friend in particular, who finds furnishing and decorating stultifying, that when he buys his house, I will invite myself over and personally hang the artwork and mirror that have been leaning against his apartment walls for years.
I routinely watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/nevertoosmall">Never Too Small</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@noahdaniel.studio">Noah Daniel</a> and have been toying with the idea of making TikToks or Instagram reels about my amateur interest in interior design.
I already have the topic for the initial video: how to get cheap artwork that you love.</p></div>

<h3 id="lounging-on-the-balcony">lounging on the balcony</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Among the finest decisions I’ve made recently is buying patio furniture for our balcony.
I bought it secondhand for $420 USD ($575 CAD), delivery included, and within a week have spent many more minutes (in either currency) lounging, reading, writing, and working on it.
I expect to recoup a good deal of the principal when we resell in a year or two.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>By furnishing the balcony we’ve added to our apartment a whole new space to be in.
It’s like a tree house, perched up among a variety of leafy growth.
Beyond the branches, in the evenings, lays the orange pink sunset silhouetting cranes on the port and past them the city skyline.
It reminds me of this bit from Gail Sheehy’s memoir:</p></div>

<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>I had found a rent-stabilized apartment on Fifth Avenue, near the Metropolitan Museum of Art… It had a terrace overlooking Central Park. A small glass cubicle sat on one end of the terrace, where I wrote as if suspended in the sky. I could watch the leaves turn from scarlet to lemony pale and sit snug in a winter storm like being enclosed in a snow globe. It was as close to a writer’s heaven as one could get.</p></div>

  <div class="paragraph"><p>Unheated, the cubicle was also ideally suited to keeping the neurons jumping. In winter I typed in a hoodie, my feet encased in Alaskan mukluks. In spring, the terrace became my first garden. I filled the window boxes with swaying tulips. Tubs held bonsai mimosa trees and dwarf crabapple trees that bore fruit in the fall. It was a magical place to invite friends for drinks and outdoor supper.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>My alcove is more modest, but magical still.
A private little post embedded in the city.
A perfect place to read and write.</p></div>

  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">

    <div class="paragraph"><p>I have a knack for picking up new books even while I have already a few on the go.
Eschewing reading etiquette in this way amuses me as if it were actual mischief.
<!--more-->
It also does a lot to maintain and continually rekindle my reading appetite.
My main book is <em>The Death and Life of Great American Cities</em>, which I’ve been reading since last fall.
I’m about 75% done, but taking my time, letting the ideas marinate and noticing <a id="2024-04-07-walk" class="" href="/vbook/walk">how they apply</a> nowadays.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>With Libby and Spotify, it’s easy to try out audiobooks, which are great for listening while doing activities with low mental demand like driving, cooking, and cleaning.
Recently I sampled <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29502354-rest"><em>Rest: Why You Get More Done When You Work Less</em></a>, because it is about a topic I’m <a id="2021-02-01-think-invisibly" class="" href="/vbook/think-invisibly">very interested</a> in and was recommended in a <a href="https://www.oliverburkeman.com/fourhours">blog post</a> by Oliver Burkeman, who I admire for his book <a id="2023-03-17-four-thousand-weeks" class="" href="/vbook/four-thousand-weeks"><em>Four Thousand Weeks: Time Management for Mortals</em></a>.
<em>Rest</em> was underwhelming and speculative, but thought-provoking.
I <a id="2020-01-12-ditch-books" class="" href="/vbook/ditch-books">ditched</a> it, but it touched on the concept of the <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Default_mode_network">Default Mode Network</a>, which has been, rather aptly, turning over in the back of my mind.
It was gratifying and intriguing to find a neuoscientific name for a phenomenon that I and many others have intuited.
In fact, I can tell that I am about to fall asleep when I am lying in bed and notice that my imagination has taken a life of its own, and that my conscious mind has left the director’s chair for a seat in the audience.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>On the other side of the spectrum of ditchability are David Graeber’s books about <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Debt:_The_First_5,000_Years">debt</a> and <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/The_Utopia_of_Rules:_On_Technology,_Stupidity,_and_the_Secret_Joys_of_Bureaucracy">bureaucracy</a>, which I’ve been listening to on Spotify and am thrilled to have discovered.
I only learned of Graeber last year and my expectations were low when I began listening to his book about <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Bullshit_Jobs"><em>Bullshit Jobs</em></a>, but recently I’ve started thinking he may have been one of the most interesting intellectuals of recent times.
I want to get physical copies of his books and re-read them studiously, delving into topics he covers to test his judgment and theories, which I find insightful and very intriguing, if at times radical.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Otherwise, I’ve been picking up books on topics that relate with things going on in my life and in my head.
Having recently returned from a <a id="2024-05-26-nyc-trip" class="" href="/vbook/nyc-trip">trip to nyc</a>, I finally cracked open my copy of <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/462198.Destinations"><em>Destinations</em></a> to read Jan Morris’s lovely piece about Manhattan.
Also, I resumed Gloria Steinem’s <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/335090.Revolution_from_Within"><em>Revolution From Within</em></a>, since I’ve been thinking a lot about self-esteem and ego.
Steinem’s reference to Alice Miller’s <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4887.The_Drama_of_the_Gifted_Child"><em>The Drama of the Gifted Child</em></a> sent me on a reading tangent about Miller’s initial advocacy for Konrad Stettbacher’s version of <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Primal_therapy">primal therapy</a> and her eventual <a href="https://www.primals.org/articles/amiller.html">denouncement</a>.
Out of curiosity, I searched for New Yorker articles mentioning Alice Miller and ended up reading <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/04/23/drawn-from-life">this New Yorker article</a> about Bechdel, whom I only knew in relation to the <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Bechdel_test">Bechdel test</a>.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I also started reading <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51409.remembered_rapture"><em>remembered rapture</em></a>, bell hooks’s essays on writing, which is a topic I think about constantly.
This in turn led me to Zora Neale Hurston’s <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37415.Their_Eyes_Were_Watching_God"><em>Their Eyes Were Watching God</em></a>, which bell hooks cites as one of the literary treasures recovered from obscurity by second wave feminism.
In fact, according to Wikipedia, new interest in Hurston’s work was sparked in 1975 by an article published in <em>Ms.</em> – Gloria Steinem’s magazine!</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Reading <a id="2023-01-28-choose-your-next-book" class="" href="/vbook/choose-your-next-book">like this</a> is so much fun and, for me, a much more <a id="2020-01-12-ditch-books" class="" href="/vbook/ditch-books">efficient</a> use of my reading appetite.</p></div>

    <div class="paragraph">
<p>Alfred Adler claimed that all problems were interpersonal relationship problems.
<!--more-->
Freudian psychoanalysts credit childhood trauma and unconscious drives as fundamental.
Lately I’ve been thinking about ego and self-image as a gravitational center that grounds our thoughts and behavior.
(Ego is an overloaded term and I’ve written about </p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/ego">my sense</a><p> of it.)</p>
</div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>I think that the ongoing <a href="https://youtu.be/GHkhTIEe254?si=qWMV2Zo8Z6qIQqet">male crisis</a> can be articulated in terms of ego and self-esteem.
I suspect the rage many men feel is </p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/exist">self-loathing reflected outward</a><p> in a desperate attempt at self-preservation.
These people are struggling for viable <a href="https://youtu.be/DHHqQDKzjTg?si=q_rw9w_xv8P4joQC">ways to exist</a>.</p>
</div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>When I first learned of Andrew Tate’s popularity with boys and young men, I was not only dismayed but surprised.
Don’t we know better already?
But misogyny is not simply a problem of ignorance.
It and other expressions of violence are tools for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acting_out">acting out</a> feelings of inadequacy and worthlessness.
To get rid of these kinds of abhorrent behavior, we have to address the source of the problem.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Instead of offering gender-agnostic advice for self-actualization, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2023/07/10/christine-emba-masculinity-new-model/">Christine Emba</a>, like psychotherapist <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Stephen_A._Shapiro">Stephen A. Shapiro</a> in the past, is trying to champion positive, overtly masculine roles:</p></div>
<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>In my ideal, the mainstream could embrace a model that acknowledges male particularity and difference but doesn’t denigrate women to do so. It’s a vision of gender that’s not androgynous but still equal, and relies on character, not just biology. And it acknowledges that certain themes — protector, provider, even procreator — still resonate with many men and should be worked with, not against.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I wonder whether this is an ideal towards which we should strive or whether it is merely a stepping stone aiming to stabilize male self-esteem as it approaches an ultimate destination.
No matter where we are on this journey, it needs to be somewhere where the male ego doesn’t feel in danger.
Because, if it does, men will return again and again to the familiar coping strategy of domination, which assuages their fear of the deepest inferiority: worthlessness.</p></div>

    <div class="paragraph"><p>Compared to The Village Vanguard, The Blue Note was a bit embarrassing.
<!--more-->
Doors open two hours before showtime, giving guests ample time to meet their $20 minimum.
Accordingly, we showed up with plenty of time to have dinner before the show.
However, after we wriggled and hopscotched into seats at the claustrophobically crammed tables, we found out that the main dishes themselves – and even some appetizers – start at $20 and reach comfortably past the upper $30s.
(As I write this and look on The Blue Note’s website to check my memory, I notice the online menu omits the prices.)
With more than an hour until showtime, we decided Z and Coco would go out for food elsewhere in Greenwich Village and I would stay and have dinner there.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>A few minutes before showtime, I went upstairs to the bathroom and stumbled upon a gift shop because of course they had a gift shop.
On the way back to my seat, I overheard a conversation at the till.
<em>Your total is $75.</em>
After a short silence, during which, I presume, the customer looked down at the two items on the counter, blinked, and looked back up: <em>How much is each item?</em></p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>At least the show was good.
The drummer, who apparently tours with Alicia Keys, was amazing.
Gleefully he battered the kit with urgency unabating as if he were Tom and the groove Jerry.
Between songs, Terrace took his time telling stories and teasing his bandmates.
Halfway through the set, he announced his guest, whose name might not ring many bells, but has been inscribed on several Grammies for cowriting hits like Bruno Mars’s <em>That’s What I Like</em> and Justin Timberlake’s <em>Pusher Love Girl</em>.
For two people in the audience the name rang not a bell but a gong, and when Terrace hesitated during the introduction, one of them cried out <em>The GOAT!</em>
Terrace nodded and confirmed, <em>the GOAT… James Fauntleroy</em>!
Out shuffled a man befitting his all-but-pop-star status: a short, chubby man wearing thick-framed glasses, a hawaiian shirt, and striped jogging pants.</p></div>

  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">

    <div class="paragraph"><p>One of our intentions for visiting NYC was to test our interest in moving there.
<!--more-->
It’s easy to fantasize, but would we actually like living there?
And if so, where, in particular?</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>For the first three nights, Z and I stayed in an Airbnb in the southern corner of Bushwick, between Broadway and Bushwick Ave.
It was obvious immediately that the area would be far too noisy for our dog, Baxter.
He is generally frightened by noise and would be reduced to a quivering lump by the thunder and shriek of the subway that runs above Broadway.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>The location was great for our trip, though.
Within walking distance we had plenty of bars, coffee shops, restaurants, convenience stores, and even a small comedy club.
It was easy to have an eventful first night despite having arrived at the Airbnb at 9pm, tired after a long day of travel from Seattle.
Also within walking distance were subway stations for the J, L, A, &amp; C lines, which made it easy to get around Brooklyn and into Manhattan on the two days following.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Bushwick, according to my friend who lives there, is the hip, artsy neighborhood that Williamsburg was ten years ago, before it fell into the sterilizing grasp of corporations.
Bushwick is gentrifying though, and walking east to west through the heart of the neighborhood you can see the process unfolding.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>On Saturday afternoon we came up out of Myrtle-Wyckoff station onto a small pedestrian strip crowded with carts and market stalls selling a variety of Latin American street food to Latino families.
We’d left the noise of the L underground, but on street level cars honked, music blared, people called and chattered, and the M ran overhead.
As we walked west on Knickerbocker Ave towards Maria Hernandez Park, we started noticing trendy-looking delis among the Mexican and Central American restaurants, and the unmistakable presence of young, white tote-carriers like us.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Despite this, the neighborhood looked no less gritty and industrial.
Until the sudden sign of corporate investment.
It announced itself when we wandered into the “Shops at the Loom,” in the form of a semi-deserted lobby furnished with tufted leather chairs that looked brand new, or at least unused.
The lobby made no more sense the farther walked into the building, past several closed offices and a surprising lack of shops.
We tried the door to a vintage clothing store, but it was locked.
Finally we came to a cafe where a young woman was singing and playing acoustic guitar.
It was occuppied sparsely and mostly by people that seemed to know the singer.
In the corner opposite the counter was a table of free kombucha and “elixirs,” attended distractedly by one of the artsy entourage.
I couldn’t spot an exit to the street.
Had everyone come in through the lobby and down the winding hallway?</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>It felt, as corporate-subsidized spaces often do, like a fake place, a place designed remotely from a real estate office rather than one developed and maintained by people that spend time there.
A cursory internet search confirms it.
The building belongs to <a href="https://www.bushburg.com/">Bushburg</a>:</p></div>

<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>An integrated real estate development and management company investing in transformative projects that create long-term value in emerging markets.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Or, in fewer words, gentrifiers incorporated.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Ventures like these feel the ickiest because their sole aim is, literally, to capitalize on a place.
And it shows in the lifelessness of the spaces they create, which neither exist for the people that inhabit them nor belong to them.
They offer what they must in order to extract value efficiently, and no more.
Why would they?
These places don’t have to be meaningful to anybody, they just have to perform as an economic resource.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Less than a mile from where I live in Seattle is South Lake Union, a prime example of a city district too smothered by corporate investment to have life.
It’s a disheartening place to be in.
But at least escape is possible on foot.
Bellevue, a quasi-city on the other side of Lake Washington, is even worse.
Its skyscrapers suggest citylife but amount to little more than vertical suburbs with convenient access to corporate offices and a high-end mall.
The entire place feels manufactured.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>It’s easy to oppose and despise this aspect of gentrification, but what about the aspects that attract people like me?
Places that I love, too, are responsible for driving up the cost of living in the areas they inhabit.
Near the Loom in Bushwick are two places now among my favorites in New York: SEY Coffee and Roberta’s.
And while these places are wonderful and, I think, worthy contributions to the local culture, they are also catalysts for the displacement of locals, a necessary step in the process of making space for people who can and want to pay more to live in the area.
People like me.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>In fact, it is precisely corporate real estate companies that make it feasible for an influx of people like me to settle in the area.

  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">

    <div class="paragraph"><p>This novel is like a long, restless dream about a man paralyzed by his guilt and his grief.
<!--more-->
Along one plotline tension builds, but then neither resolves nor dissipates completely.
It remains an anonymous threat hanging over the protagonist’s head, a darkling mystery suspended, never precipitating.
It’s a confounding book, and one that I would be thrilled to see adapted into film by David Lynch.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>It is never clear who is after the protagonist, Bobby, or why.
It seems at first related to his presence at a suspicious scene in a sunken airplane, which he encountered while working as a salvage diver.
Later, it seems that anonymous authorities are after his father’s old papers.
Mysterious men pay periodic visits and ask questions.
Some of Bobby’s belongings are stolen.
His cat disappears.
His car get confiscated.
The persecution seems operated through the US government, but it’s carried out obliquely and underhandedly.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Regardless, Bobby lives his life as if in penance.
He is stuck in limbo, confined by his apparent ambivalence towards life, which has him constantly approaching and evading danger, all the while awaiting his death.
He camps out for a while in a shed near a deserted beach.
When his stalkers seem to be closing in, he flees from New Orleans to Idaho and squats in a derelict house in the freezing cold.
In the end, he settles in the southern coast of Spain, holed up in a windmill with a crumbling roof.
In the quiet of these exiles, without the comfort of shared food, drink, and conversation, the pitch of his grief reaches shrieking, hallucinatory levels, setting the stage for quasi-spiritual moments of revelation.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>The most potent aspect of this book is probably its mood, which reflects the hopeless remorse that Bobby feels.
Remorse for the unholy devastation of Hiroshima and Nagasaki that his father and mother helped engineer.
Regret for his helplessness before the great mysteries of mathematics and physical science.
In these Bobby seems to bear the burden not just for himself and his family, but for all of humanity.
Principally, however, Bobby’s remorse and grief are for his inability to prevent his sister’s suicide and their inability to enact the deep, incestuous love between them.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Throughout the book, Cormac depicts Bobby’s agonizing internal conflict regarding his feelings for his sister.
Here, from page 184, is one of the most memorable:</p></div>
<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>In his dreams of her she wore at times a smile he tried to remember and she would say to him almost in a chant words he could scarcely follow.
He knew that her lovely face would soon exist nowhere save in his memories and in his dreams and soon after that nowhere at all.
She came in half nude trailing sarsenet or perhaps just her Grecian sheeting crossing a stone stage in the smoking footlamps or she would push back the cowl of her robe and her blonde hair would fall about her face as she bent to him where he lay in the damp and clammy sheets and whisper to him I’d have been your shadowlane, the keeper of that house alone wherein your soul is safe.
And all the while a clangor like the labor of a foundry and dark figures in silhouette about the alchemic fires, the ash and the smoke.
The floor lay littered with the stillborn forms of their efforts and still they labored on, the raw halfsentient mud quivering red in the autoclave.
In that dusky penetralium they press about the crucible shoving and gibbering while the deep heresiarch dark in his folded cloak urges them on in their efforts.
And then what thing unspeakable is this raised dripping up through crust and calyx from what hellish marinade.
He woke sweating and switched on the bedlamp and swung his feet to the floor and sat with his face in his hands.
Dont be afraid for me, she had written.
When has death ever harmed anyone?</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The prose is a major reason I keep picking up books written by McCarthy.
Who else </p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/write-like-cormac">writes like this</a><p>?</p>
</div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Here, from pages 115 and 116, is another striking example of McCarthy’s prose – a description of the scenes following the dropping of the atomic bombs in Japan:</p></div>

<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>There were people who escaped from Hiroshima and rushed to Nagasaki to see that their loved ones were safe.
Arriving just in time to be incinerated.
He went there after the war with a team of scientists.
My father.
He said that everything was rusty.
Everything looked covered with rust.
There were burnt-out shells of trolleycars standing in the streets.
The glass melted out of the sashes and pooled on the bricks.
Seated on the blackened springs the charred skeletons of the passengers with their clothes and hair gone and their bones hung with blackened strips of flesh.
Their eyes boiled from their sockets.
Lips and noses burned away.
Sitting in their seats laughing.
The living walked about but there was no place to go.
They waded by the thousands into the river and died there.
They were like insects in that no one direction was preferable to another.
Burning people crawled among the corpses like some horror in a vast crematorium.
They simply thought that the world had ended.
It hardly even occurred to them that it had anything to do with the war.
They carried their skin bundled up in their arms before them like wash that it not drag in the rubble and ash and they passed one another mindlessly on their mindless journeyings over the smoking afterground, the sighted no better served than the blind.
Those who survived would often remember these horrors with a certain aesthetic to them.
In that mycoidal phantom blooming in the dawn like an evil lotus and in the melting of solid not heretofore known to do so stood a truth that would silence poetry a thousand years.
Like an immense bladder, they would say.
Like some sea thing.
Wobbling slightly on the near horizon.
Then the unspeakable noise.
They saw birds in the dawn sky ignite and explode soundlessly and fall in long arcs earthward like burning party favors.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>McCarthy doesn’t make it clear what “truth” the mushroom cloud embodied, but it is certainly not a comforting one.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Later, on pages 175 and 176, he describes a factory where uranium was prepared for the bombs:</p></div>

<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>His mother was nineteen when she went to work at Y-12, the electromagnetic separation plant.
One of the three processes for the separation of the uranium 235 isotope.
The workers were driven out to the compound in buses, bumping over the rough graded road, through dust or mud given the weather.
Talking was not allowed.
The barbed wire fencing ran for miles and the buildings were of solid concrete, massive things, monolithic and for the most part windowless.
They sat in a great selvage of raw mud beyond which lay a perimeter of the wrecked and twisted trees that had been bulldozed from the site.
She said it looked as if they had just somehow emerged out of the ground.
The buildings.
There was no accounting for them.
She looked at the other women on the bus but they seemed to have abandoned themselves and she thought that she might be the only one of them that while she did not know what this was about knew all too well that it was Godless and that while it had poisoned back to elemental mud all living things upon that ground yet it was far from being done.
It was just the beginning.</p></div>

  <div class="paragraph"><p>The buildings held over one thousand miles of pipe and a quarter million valves.
The women sat on stools and monitored the dials in front of them while uranium atoms raced the tracks in the calutrons.
Measuring them a hundred thousand times each second.
The magnets that propelled them were seven feet in diameter and the windings were of solid silver fabricated from fiteen thousands tons of it borrowed from the US Treasury because all the copper had already gone into the war effort.
An older woman told her that the first day with the women all at their stations and having no least notion what any of this was about the engineers had thrown the consecutive switches and an enormous dynamo hum filled the hall and hairpins in their hundreds shot from the women’s heads and crossed the room like hornets.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>That last sentence is exquisitely crafted.
A tremendously vivid scene realized in fifty eight words assembled fluidly without any interrupting punctuation.</p></div>

    <div class="paragraph"><p>I’m 120 pages into this book and so far it has consisted purely of dialogue between a psychiatrist and a patient who has voluntarily checked herself in.
<!--more-->
Dialogue between these two I expect will fill the rest of the book.
It’s an exciting endeavor to witness Cormac attempt.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>He published this book alongside </p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/the-passenger"><em>The Passenger</em></a><p> in 2022 as a “companion novel” known also as <em>The Passenger #2</em>.
I tried this one first though because among its topics are math and philosophy.
It is set chronologically after <em>The Passenger</em>, but my impression, assembled from fragments of scantily skimmed book summaries, is that reading them in either order is fine.</p>
</div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>(Even more than novel summaries I avoid movie trailers.
They reveal far too much.
I’d be happy to watch them if instead of crudely summarizing the story and undermining its telling they showed a short sample of the movie.
A scene at most and no more.)</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>This book is clearly a product of the years Cormac spent at the Santa Fe Institute (SFI) in conversation with scientists and researchers discussing consciousness, mathematics, physics, language, and philosophy.
Much of what the protagonist Alicia says – about the unconscious, Wittgenstein, Heidegger, mathematics  – Cormac himself says in conversation with SFI’s President David Krakauer in <a href="https://youtu.be/HrUy1Vn2KdI?si=awtdDfdZqwE7qzfS">this interview</a> from 2017.
The interview is good companion material to the companion novel.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>This book reminds me of another, which I intend to return to when I finish this one: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/782783.A_Dialogue_on_Personal_Identity_and_Immortality">A Dialogue on Personal Identity and Immortality</a>, in which a philosopher lying on her deathbed argues with her friend against the likelihood of an afterlife.
In <em>Stella Maris</em> death also looms – not just over the protagonist but also its author.
Cormac died six months after this final publication.</p></div>

    <div class="paragraph"><p>In her <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2024/05/27/the-secrets-of-suspense">New Yorker article</a> about suspense, Kathryn Schulz uses a clever image to describe how suspense exists at many scales.
<!--more--></p></div>

<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>Suspense does not derive only from the machinations of plot. Instead, it is what you might call fractal: it can be fostered at every level, from a seven-season TV series all the way down to a chapter, a paragraph, a scene, or even a silence.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Her choice of the word <strong>fractal</strong> conjures, for me at least, the kaleidoscopic image of triangles within triangles within triangles, ad infinitum.
She then applies the image onto her subject, suspense in storytelling, which is a neat way to depict it as occuring at scales spanning from large to minute.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>There is one wrinkle, though.
The word <strong>fostered</strong>.
It’s not the right word.
How does one foster a fractal?
I suppose one can foster suspense, but that’s not a particularly strong match either.
Regardless, we are in the middle of likening suspense to fractals, so whatever word we choose should coordinate with the image of fractals, or at least not clash with it.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Some alternatives to <strong>fostered</strong> that come to mind are <strong>replicated</strong>, <strong>recreated</strong>, <strong>reproduced</strong>, <strong>repeated</strong>.
But a simple <strong>applied</strong> will serve as well:</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>The Village Vanguard was well worth visiting.
Not only is it a historic jazz venue, but their minimum purchase is just one drink.
Kurt Rosenwinkel and his band were great.</p></div>

This excerpt, from Jan Morris’s splendid ode to the wild vibrancy of <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/462198.Destinations">Manhattan (1979)</a>, rang true:</p></div>
<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>Manhattan long ago abandoned its melting-pot function. Nobody even tries to Americanize the Lebanese or the Lithuanians now, and indeed the ethnic enclaves of the island seem to me to become more potently ethnic each time I visit the place.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The ferry was great.
Cheap, easy, and quiet.
The views were great and various.
In FiDi I was shocked at the quantity of tourists.
We only went there because it was the ferry’s terminus, but it was interesting to see it after reading Jane Jacobs’s critique of it in </p>

<div class="paragraph"><p>The Lower East Side was charming, and it was memorable to eat outside on Bond Street, but the food was pricey.

<div class="paragraph"><p>Revisited INFINITEA and sat again at the table on the sidewalk, looking out on to the street.
It was a delightful way to start the day, and I repeated again for the next two days.
I’m glad I went to the MoMA while Z &amp; Coco went to the Met.
I love walking around museums alone, listening to my music.
This time it occurred to me to leave after a couple hours, have a meal, a coffee, and come back.
I think I’ll be adding that to my museum routine.
Several restaurants in the area give a discount if you show them your MoMA ticket.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Compared to the Village Vanguard, the </p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/blue-note">Blue Note</a><p> was a bit embarrassing.
Afterwards, walking through Greenwich Village at night, I felt like I was in an amusement park – the heat, the neon signs, people in every direction walking and talking, going into and out of venues, bars and restaurants spilling out onto sidewalk patios.
We got cocktails and then slices to go.
It was a quiet thrill.</p>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Our last day was unexpectedly memorable.
We walked up through Ditmars Steinway and took Citi Bikes to Astoria Park and rode them along the water.
We liked it so much that we looped around and did it again before heading back for our bags to go to the airport.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I found Ditmars Steinway charming enough that I wondered if we might look for apartments there if we ever move to New York.
It seems to strike a great balance between peacefulness and liveliness.
I’m sure many New Yorkers would scoff or snort if I suggested it is an accessible location, but in its center is the Astoria-Ditmars Blvd station, from which runs the N through Astoria, into and all the way down Manhattan, into Brooklyn and all the way through to Coney Island.
Bushwick, however, is not on that path, and would be painful to reach.
Looking at the subway map, it’s clear the routes were designed primarily for commute in and out of Manhattan.</p></div>

    <div class="paragraph"><p>Compared to The Village Vanguard, The Blue Note was a bit embarrassing.
<!--more-->
Doors open two hours before showtime, giving guests ample time to meet their $20 minimum.
Accordingly, we showed up with plenty of time to have dinner before the show.
However, after we wriggled and hopscotched into seats at the claustrophobically crammed tables, we found out that the main dishes themselves – and even some appetizers – start at $20 and reach comfortably past the upper $30s.
(As I write this and look on The Blue Note’s website to check my memory, I notice the online menu omits the prices.)
With more than an hour until showtime, we decided Z and Coco would go out for food elsewhere in Greenwich Village and I would stay and have dinner there.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>A few minutes before showtime, I went upstairs to the bathroom and stumbled upon a gift shop because of course they had a gift shop.
On the way back to my seat, I overheard a conversation at the till.
<em>Your total is $75.</em>
After a short silence, during which, I presume, the customer looked down at the two items on the counter, blinked, and looked back up: <em>How much is each item?</em></p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>At least the show was good.
The drummer, who apparently tours with Alicia Keys, was amazing.
Gleefully he battered the kit with urgency unabating as if he were Tom and the groove Jerry.
Between songs, Terrace took his time telling stories and teasing his bandmates.
Halfway through the set, he announced his guest, whose name might not ring many bells, but has been inscribed on several Grammies for cowriting hits like Bruno Mars’s <em>That’s What I Like</em> and Justin Timberlake’s <em>Pusher Love Girl</em>.
For two people in the audience the name rang not a bell but a gong, and when Terrace hesitated during the introduction, one of them cried out <em>The GOAT!</em>
Terrace nodded and confirmed, <em>the GOAT… James Fauntleroy</em>!
Out shuffled a man befitting his all-but-pop-star status: a short, chubby man wearing thick-framed glasses, a hawaiian shirt, and striped jogging pants.</p></div>

My tasks continue to be interesting and plenty.
However, it looks like my next promotion, which I was expecting in September, won’t happen until December.
I’m disappointed, but when I reflect on it carefully, I notice it’s not that important.
By no means do I <em>need</em> to be promoted.
It’s alluring because it’s a quantifiable and salient achievement.
But it’s not important one.</p></div>

    <div class="paragraph"><p>I wrote an essay called <a href="https://okjuan.medium.com/the-virtual-book-part-1-782ccd4cc360">The Virtual Book</a> but I never defined the term.
<!--more-->
By virtual book I mean a book unbound by the traditional and physical constraints of printed books.
I say ‘virtual’ because the greatest possibilities I see are in the virtual world of computers.
Ebooks and audiobooks are just the beginning.
The possibilities that excite me challenge not only the physicality of books but also their more subtle attributes.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>A virtual book can be <strong>multimedia</strong>.
It can consist of words, images, video, audio.
There, we got the obvious one out of the way.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>A virtual book can be <strong>readerdriven</strong>.
Instead of forcing readers to follow the author’s thought process, a virtual book can let each reader steer the way.
Wikipedia does this already.
It lets you search the page for keywords, skip to the section you’re interested in, and even escape into a tangential topic, never to return.
This is a natural way to consume Wikipedia because its form <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Affordance">affords</a> it.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Books generally have one start and one ending, but a virtual book can be <strong>nonlinear</strong>.
Wikipedia is again the obvious example.
But letting the reader drive is only one way to create a nonlinear book.
It’s also possible to create multiple entrypoints, or even multiple endings, like <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Black_Mirror:_Bandersnatch">Black Mirror: Bandersnatch</a>.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>A virtual book can be <strong>dynamic</strong>.
It can change after its initial creation.
Printed books, on the other hand, are static snapshots laboriously rendered by a particular author at a particular time.
But what if a theory is debunked?
Or a hypothesis confirmed?
Or a record shattered?
Or, in the case of storytelling, what if a loose end can be tied up neatly?</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>A virtual book can be <strong>nonmonolithic</strong>.
It does not need to be discrete or selfcontained.
It can consist of many interconnected parts that make up the whole but can exist without it.
It can reference other virtual books, borrow bits from them, and lend bits of its own.
For example, if Herbie Hancock’s memoir was a virtual audiobook, it could allow its snippets to be reconstrued into a documentary about jazz.
(If Ken Burns’ Jazz documentary series was also ‘virtualized’, it could have been updated 15 years after its release to include bits of Herbie’s narration.)
In fact, it could provide material for documentaries about many different topics: jazz, funk, hip hop, Miles Davis, Black Nationalism, Nichiren Buddhism, meditation, and crack addictions, to name some of the obvious ones.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>A virtual book can be <strong>responsive</strong>.
What if a reader could expect a book to field spontaneous questions?
ChatGPT is an obvious candidate here, but the possibility is broader.
What if Herbie Hancock returned to his memoir every now and then to answer questions that readers had left behind while reading it?
What if readers could raise flags on issues that factcheckers would then verify or return to the author for amendment?</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>The possibilities are plenty, and they are thrilling.
The difficulty in realizating them is not technological, but legal and political.
Powerful companies – and therefore governments – are hugely incentivized to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Swartz">prevent the free exchange of “intellectual property”</a>.
To make virtual books possible, we need not only the technological power of software, but also its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons">progressive politics</a>.</p></div>

    <div class="paragraph"><p>I wrote an essay called <a href="https://okjuan.medium.com/the-virtual-book-part-1-782ccd4cc360">The Virtual Book</a> but I never defined the term.
<!--more-->
By virtual book I mean a book unbound by the traditional and physical constraints of printed books.
I say ‘virtual’ because the greatest possibilities I see are in the virtual world of computers.
Ebooks and audiobooks are just the beginning.
The possibilities that excite me challenge not only the physicality of books but also their more subtle attributes.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>A virtual book can be <strong>multimedia</strong>.
It can consist of words, images, video, audio.
There, we got the obvious one out of the way.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>A virtual book can be <strong>readerdriven</strong>.
Instead of forcing readers to follow the author’s thought process, a virtual book can let each reader steer the way.
Wikipedia does this already.
It lets you search the page for keywords, skip to the section you’re interested in, and even escape into a tangential topic, never to return.
This is a natural way to consume Wikipedia because its form <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Affordance">affords</a> it.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Books generally have one start and one ending, but a virtual book can be <strong>nonlinear</strong>.
Wikipedia is again the obvious example.
But letting the reader drive is only one way to create a nonlinear book.
It’s also possible to create multiple entrypoints, or even multiple endings, like <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Black_Mirror:_Bandersnatch">Black Mirror: Bandersnatch</a>.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>A virtual book can be <strong>dynamic</strong>.
It can change after its initial creation.
Printed books, on the other hand, are static snapshots laboriously rendered by a particular author at a particular time.
But what if a theory is debunked?
Or a hypothesis confirmed?
Or a record shattered?
Or, in the case of storytelling, what if a loose end can be tied up neatly?</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>A virtual book can be <strong>nonmonolithic</strong>.
It does not need to be discrete or selfcontained.
It can consist of many interconnected parts that make up the whole but can exist without it.
It can reference other virtual books, borrow bits from them, and lend bits of its own.
For example, if Herbie Hancock’s memoir was a virtual audiobook, it could allow its snippets to be reconstrued into a documentary about jazz.
(If Ken Burns’ Jazz documentary series was also ‘virtualized’, it could have been updated 15 years after its release to include bits of Herbie’s narration.)
In fact, it could provide material for documentaries about many different topics: jazz, funk, hip hop, Miles Davis, Black Nationalism, Nichiren Buddhism, meditation, and crack addictions, to name some of the obvious ones.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>A virtual book can be <strong>responsive</strong>.
What if a reader could expect a book to field spontaneous questions?
ChatGPT is an obvious candidate here, but the possibility is broader.
What if Herbie Hancock returned to his memoir every now and then to answer questions that readers had left behind while reading it?
What if readers could raise flags on issues that factcheckers would then verify or return to the author for amendment?</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>The possibilities are plenty, and they are thrilling.
The difficulty in realizating them is not technological, but legal and political.
Powerful companies – and therefore governments – are hugely incentivized to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Swartz">prevent the free exchange of “intellectual property”</a>.
To make virtual books possible, we need not only the technological power of software, but also its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons">progressive politics</a>.</p></div>

<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>What if a memoirist publishes a piece overlaid with their revisions to show the process of expression and expose the artifice of memoir?
…
What if a novelist publishes a first-person novel in real time to make it feel like the character really exists and is experiencing events alongside the reader?
What if the author then goes back and rewrites previous parts of the novel to show the decay of memory and its corruption in the construction of personal narratives?</p></div>

    <div class="paragraph"><p>Can quantifying the attributes of a TV show tell us something about its quality?
<!--more-->
I reckon some of the flaws in <em>House of the Dragon</em> would be reflected in statistics like amount of dialogue per minute and number of decisions made per character.
A non-negligible amount of time is spent on dramatic montages and orchestral music that create a moody atmosphere and remind us of how serious the situation is.
This comes at the cost of time that could be spent on actual situations and actual drama, or at least character development that would contribute to future drama.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>These two elements – dialogue and decision-making – each give us an independent perspective into a character, but their combination is especially powerful because it gives us a third angle: insight into what a character is <em>thinking</em>, including what they are thinking unconsciously.
From this we get what might be the critical ingredient of great story-telling: three-dimensional characters.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>My qualm with shows like <em>House of the Dragon</em> is that their plot feels designed and implemented.
I sense the presence of writers and their attempts to show me what’s happening and persuade me that it makes sense.
I can’t get lost in the fictional world as if it were a real one because I see the pencil marks from when it was sketched out.
My <a href="https://omni.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Suspension_of_disbelief">suspension of disbelief</a> never takes off.
One might say, Well, yeah, all fictional plots are prescribed.
But they’re not, and writers like Stephen King and Cormac McCarthy have <a id="2023-12-01-where-ideas-come-from" class="" href="/vbook/where-ideas-come-from">attested to it</a>.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>In great shows like <em>The Sopranos</em>, plot is not implemented, it’s incubated.
The show feels to me like it’s happening spontaneously, developing by itself as a sequence of events, reactions, and actions.
In every episode there is constant dialogue between characters and a steady supply of situations that require characters to make decisions.
And much of the time, these have nothing to do with plot.
Every season has at least one major narrative arc, but the dependence is flipped.
Episodes don’t depend on an overarching plot for their meaning.
Episodes generate the plot.
Characters are agents, not passengers.
I don’t feel like the writers are leading me to the plot’s predetermined destination.
In fact I don’t feel their presence at all.
I feel like I’m <a id="2022-06-11-tell-a-story" class="" href="/vbook/tell-a-story">witnessing something</a>.</p></div>

Rewatched S1 in preparation for S2, which is currently airing.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Fantasmas</strong>.
Unsettling in a very effective way, like a hyper-pop Black Mirror.
Wonderfully weird and delightfully non-linear.
By now I know I am a sucker for tangential and episodic storytelling.</p></div>

<h3 id="watching-movies">watching movies</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Dream Scenario</strong>.
Unsettling.
I kept oscillating between sympathy and disgust for the main character, an intended effect, I think.
However, ultimately, it didn’t seem to have a cogent point to make.
Or maybe I missed it.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Challengers</strong>.
Very entertaining.
I loved the toxic triangle between the three main characters: one chooses to be dominated, one needs to dominate, and one dominates himself to preclude others doing it.
The codependence and power dynamics rang true until they fell a bit flat towards the end.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Radical Wolfe</strong>, documentary about writer Tom Wolfe (and former colleague of Gloria Steinem at <em>New York</em> magazine).
Somewhat entertaining but suspiciously uncritical, as biopics and posthumous documentary tributes tend to be.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Enjoying the rare and splendid sunny days of PNW summer.
Biking, paddleboarding, playing soccer, volleyball with friends.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I’m curious about playing goalkeeper for a new team.
I’ve been an outfield player exclusively for years, but I used to play goalie part-time and fill in when needed.
I miss it a bit.
And goalies are always in demand, so it should be an easy way to get more playing time.
Hopefully I’m not overestimating my skills in net.
I think I’ll find out soon.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Cap Hill Block Party.
Excited about seeing Chappell Roan, who is apparently great to see live.</p></div>
