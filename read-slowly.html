    <div class="paragraph"><p>Starting a new book is exciting.
<!--more-->
It’s like putting on a brand new pair of shoes on a sunny morning, with no puddles in sight.
Sadly, the novelty wears off.
Then, there’s that uncomfortable feeling at the prospect of leaving the book unfinished.
The same book that starts as an exciting little activity becomes a nagging reminder that you failed to reach a goal.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Nobody likes starting a book and failing to finish it.
So much so, I suspect, that it discourages us from starting a new one, in fear of not reaching the end.
After all, who signs up for a marathon that they don’t expect to finish? Even if you ran an impressive 20 miles, you wouldn’t get the exhilaration of crossing the finish line and the satisfaction of officially achieving a commendable, well-defined goal that other people recognize and admire.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>But is reading a book really about reading every single page that someone put between two covers? On principle, I think people would agree reading is about getting exposed to ideas that inform and influence the way we think.
Surely, then, we can be done with a book regardless of whether we read it from beginning to end.
And if we’ve “finished” the book in this way, shouldn’t we walk away satisfied and guilt-free?</p></div>

<h3 id="break-your-new-years-resolution">Break Your New Year’s Resolution</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Setting a goal number of books to read can foster the habit of reading regularly, a habit we all admire and covet.
However, it’s easy to get carried away with trying to make measurable progress at the expense of approaching your actual goal.
If you get fixated on officially finishing a book, you might be forgetting why you wanted to read it in the first place.
By ditching a book when you feel you’ve had enough of it, you’re staying true to the real reason you set that goal of reading some special number of books by Christmas time.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>In <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/41181911">Super Thinking: The Big Book of Mental Models</a> by Gabriel Weinberg and Lauren McCann, the authors tell a <a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/hanoi-rat-massacre-1902">true story</a> about a government that offered civilians bounty for killing rats in an effort to mitigate the local rat infestation.
Specifically, they offered people money for each rat tail they brought in.
They figured they could reliably track progress on the pest problem without having to handle the corpses.
The plan backfired completely.
Crafty entrepreneurs realized that they could capture a rat, cut off its tail, and then release it, so that it would live on to reproduce: more rats, more tails, more money.
The pest problem worsened significantly.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>But why all the gossip about rodents and dishonest bounty hunters? Well, Weinberg and McCann’s point is that metrics can be counterproductive.
In the case of reading books, if you worry too much about how many books you’ve read front-to-back, you stray from your objective of learning and growing.
Maybe you should change your metric or add a new one: the number of books checked out of the library, or the number of books you read for at least one hour.
Anything that helps you make real progress and not counting rat tails.</p></div>

<h3 id="avoid-the-sunk-cost-fallacy">Avoid the Sunk-Cost Fallacy</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Books aren’t perfect.
Many of them are good.
Many others are just okay.
Sometimes, you benefit by leaving a book unfinished and moving on to another instead of persevering through to the end, regardless of how far you’ve made it.
In that case, by quitting the book, you’re overriding a psychological flaw and making a more rational choice.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>The <strong>sunk-cost fallacy</strong>, as defined in <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11468377-thinking-fast-and-slow">Thinking, Fast &amp; Slow</a> by Daniel Kahneman is:</p></div>
<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>The decision to invest additional resources in a losing account, when better investments are available.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>We fall prey to this error when we stick stubbornly with a book just because of the time we’ve already sunk into it.
If this book is no longer doing it for you, move on.
There are millions of other books and many of them are better than this one.
If you can cut your losses and push through the unpleasantness that comes with doing so, you’ve likely made the optimal choice.</p></div>

<h3 id="read-other-books">Read Other Books</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>If you feel guilty about not finishing a book you’re currently reading, you probably won’t start a new book.
And so, if the book you’re reading loses your interest, you’ll end up losing steam and maybe reading no book at all.
Unless it is important to you to finish this specific book, why not move on and keep your momentum going? By leaving a book unfinished and feeling good about it, you allow yourself to start a new book with excitement instead of guilt.</p></div>

<h3 id="youre-not-absorbing-much-anymore">You’re Not Absorbing Much Anymore</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>We’ve all finished reading a paragraph only to realize that we didn’t absorb much of the information at all.
It can happen when we’re having trouble focusing, but it can also happen when you’ve lost interest.
That’s okay.
It might be time to move on.
Life is long, you can come back to this book in some weeks, months, or even years if it’s a book you think is worth reading eventually.
By moving on, you are valuing results above all else.</p></div>

<h3 id="sacrifice-depth-for-breadth">Sacrifice Depth for Breadth</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>If you learn to ditch books with confidence, you’ll cover more variety of material.
I think this is true not only because you start the next book sooner, but also because you avoid the reading slump you’ll inevitably hit when you’ve committed to a book that you have no interest in reading.
By moving on to another book, you’re covering more ground when it isn’t worth staying put and drilling down for more.</p></div>

<h3 id="its-not-worth-your-time">It’s Not Worth Your Time</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>You might benefit a lot from a book early on, but less so in later chapters.
Perhaps you’ve effectively satisfied your curiosity, or maybe the book’s value is distributed unevenly across its sections.
Regardless, you’re facing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diminishing_returns">diminishing returns</a> and the book might not be worth your time anymore.
By ditching the book, you’re reacting intelligently to a waning profit.</p></div>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>If we choose to finish a book, let’s make that choice for a good reason, and not because leaving it unfinished feels like failure.
Moreover, let’s relish the opportunity to make the smart, if counterintuitive, choice of bailing on a book when it isn’t worth the time.
If we overcome the mental hurdles that stop us from ditching a book even when we are justified, we’ll be free to read more widely and engage more deeply.</p></div>

<!--more-->
We should also fight the urge to read books quickly.
If a book grabs your attention and pulls you in, go ahead.
But don’t hurry through sentences to make your reading session feel more productive.
Read a chunk and consider what you’re getting out of it.
If there’s nothing to digest, then why are you reading it?</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>We forget much of what we read.
The lessons books teach us are hard to recall on command.
We are painfully reminded of this every time we try to summarize a book in conversation with someone.
But this doesn’t mean that we gained nothing.
The lessons get translated and encoded into our thought process.
We incorporate them into our habits, our beliefs.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>This happens easily when something we read rouses our curiosity.
We compare it with things we know.
We notice how it differs.
We ask follow-up questions.
We imagine new things.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>By slowing down, we encourage more of these interactions.
If you watch yourself while you read, you can see how much attention you’re actually paying.
You can catch yourself tuning out even as the words still shove through your mind.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Even a great book will lose you at some point.
A person can only read for so long.
Put the book down and think about what you just read.
Imagine how to apply what you just learned.
How you already do it, or why it wouldn’t work.</p></div>
