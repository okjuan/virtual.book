  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">

    <div class="paragraph"><p>I heartily agree with Crawford’s emphasis on the importance of embodied experiences and his warning that virtual worlds can promote passivity, technology as magic, and false agency.
<!--more-->
<em>However</em>.
I am also very enthusiastic about technological tools as real tools and virtual worlds as deeply enriching.
Consider books for example.
They are a virtual, symbolic world of their own and were object of <a id="2024-08-11-end-of-absence" class="" href="/vbook/end-of-absence">moral panic</a> in their own time.
But I think most of us would consider them indispensable now.
Books are fictions divorced from physicality, but is that inherently bad?
I don’t think so.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I am several chapters in but already think Crawford’s argument needs work.
His critique of “representations” and “abstractions” needs a lot more development in my opinion.
I’d invoke him to reflect on his own life to rebalance his argument: he loves to ride motorcycles and fix them up, but he also loves to read books and write them.
Surely he needs to make space for symbolic experiences alongside physical ones?
I say this despite agreeing with his insight on the surprising hollowness of Choice as Freedom and the way resource-extractive corporations exploit this to harvest wealth from consumers.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>All in all I think he makes some fantastic, nuanced points but builds a shaky overarching argument from it.
I would love to him to take a second crack at it.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p><em>I originally wrote the above <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/o6efsb/comment/m0yv7mk/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">on Reddit</a> after reading the first half the book.</em></p></div>

<hr>

<div class="paragraph"><p>As I’ve said <a id="2025-01-11-now" class="" href="/vbook/now-jan-11-2025">else</a><a id="2025-01-12-2024-in-review" class="" href="/vbook/2024">where</a>, I really appreciated that this book resisted taking the reactionary stance against technology as inherently insidious and unavoidably corruptive of our psychological wellbeing.
In the epilogue, Crawford summarizes his alternative critique of technology’s role in leeching on our attention:</p></div>

<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>The problem…of distraction…is usually discussed as a problem of technology. I [suggest] we view the problem as more fundamentally one of political economy. In a culture saturated with technologies for appropriating our attention, our interior mental lives are laid bare as a resource to be harvested by others. Viewing it this way shifts our gaze from the technology itself to the intention that guides its design and its dissemination into every area of life.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>This perspective excites me not just because it rings truer but also because it prevents indiscriminate rejection of technology and instead makes possible a judicious trust that allows us to make good use of it.</p></div>

<h3 id="missing-japan">missing japan</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>We just got back <a id="2024-12-26-japan-trip" class="" href="/vbook/japan-trip">from Japan</a>.
I would love to live there for a while someday, although I think it unlikely, even though they offer a six month Digital Nomad visa.
Z’s work is not remote and she wants to develop her career, so teaching English or something of the sort is not particularly useful to her.
Regardless, I am sure we will visit again.</p></div>

<h3 id="losing-weight">losing weight</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I am twenty pounds lighter than I was a year and a half ago.
I still want to lose another twenty.
I am trying to eat very consciously and exercise everyday.
I feel optimistic.</p></div>

<h3 id="experimenting-with-daily-routines">experimenting with daily routines</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>For the last few days I have woken up early and immediately gone out on a walk with my coffee.
It’s a lovely way to warm up for the day and start by accomplishing my daily task of exercising.
Walking is useful for me given that I am a homebody with a remote computer job and a reliance on soccer for exercise.
After returning from my morning walks I’ve spent some time reading before getting on with my day.
An aspiration I’ve set for myself is to do each of these everyday: exercise, read, write, work, enjoy, socialize, discuss, grow, &amp; plan.
I realize they might sound cheesy, but they are distillations of more specific intentions I have for 2025.</p></div>

<h3 id="working">working</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>In December I received my expected promotion to Senior Software Engineer.
It’s a milestone in my career.
The pay bump was nice if modest for industry standards, but the biggest perk is the deference I am already getting as part of the increase in my responsibilities.
I have strong opinions on how certain things should be done and I feel already a boost in persuasive power generated from my new title.
To summarize, I feel like I have more agency, and I welcome it.</p></div>

<h3 id="reading-writing-and-avoiding-distractions">reading, writing, and avoiding distractions</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Matthew B. Crawford’s <a id="2024-12-07-world-beyond-your-head" class="" href="/vbook/world-beyond-your-head"><em>The World Beyond Your Head</em></a> has provoked in me a lot of reflection about what things consume my attention and how <a id="2024-12-15-ecologies-of-attention" class="" href="/vbook/attention">environ</a><a id="2024-12-15-ecologies-of-attention" class="" href="/vbook/attention">ments</a> dictate that.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I recently read <a id="2024-12-19-molloy" class="" href="/vbook/molloy"><em>Molloy</em></a> by Samuel Beckett and I intend to continue with the second book in the trilogy.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I also resumed reading and marveling at the prose in <em>Blood Meridian</em>.
I think it appropriate to take my time with what Harold Bloom called  “the major esthetic achievement of any living American writer.”
Of course, McCarthy has since died and his legacy has begun morphing due to recent news of a very inappropriate relationship he had with a teenage girl named Augusta Britt.</p></div>

<h3 id="watching-movies">watching movies</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Last year as soon as the weather started cooling and days darkening early I started watching movies.
In the last few months I’ve watched <em>The Substance</em>, <em>Woman of the Hour</em>, <em>We Live In Time</em>, <em>The Godfather</em> and <em>The Godfather Part 2</em>, <em>The Power of the Dog</em>, <em>Killers of the Flower Moon</em>, <em>Anora</em>, <em>A Real Pain</em>, <em>Perfect Days</em>, <em>Gladiator II</em>, and <em>Punch-Drunk Love</em>.
Reviews and ratings for these are or will be on <a href="https://letterboxd.com/okjuanito/films/reviews/">my letterboxd account</a>.
Tomorrow I’m going to watch <em>The Brutalist</em>.</p></div>

<h3 id="following-arsenal">following Arsenal</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Following the English Premier League is so interesting because the competition is so fierce and sophisticated.
It is so difficult for teams to win.
It is so difficult for fans or pundits to predict what will happen.
New players arrive, old ones fall away, young ones rise into prominence.
It’s a lucrative business but it is also genuine, gripping drama.</p></div>

<hr>

<h3 id="whats-next">what’s next?</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>The year 2025 is a blank canvas.
We don’t have any specific plans.
Of course, it is predictable in some ways.
But perhaps more so, it is open ended.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I begin the year with several intentions.
Do big things at work.
Get fitter.
Lose twenty pounds.
Have more discussions with friends.
Read copiously.
Keep writing for and developing this site.
Nurture friendships.
Heal and grow.
Enjoy our DINK status.
Ruminate on longterm plans.</p></div>

<hr>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I round the corner of another year with the intention to change my life.
Change it not majorly, but minorly.
I intend to live in the same place, work the same job, drink the same coffee.
But I want to sharpen my focus.
I intend to withhold my attention a bit more and marshall it with more discipline towards things that matter.
That doesn’t mean I will scold myself if I waste time, or spend it on unimportant things.
But I want to try everyday to dedicate <em>more</em> attention to things that matter, to things that will accumulate rather than disappear into the void like jewelry into the drain.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I will continue resisting idealistic aspirations towards abstract virtue, but will try to submit myself to disciplines that I trust will render concrete results.
Spending more time reading.
Waking earlier.
Avoiding cheap distractions that undermine opportunities to spend time meaningfully.
I’m not so interested in deeming time spent scrolling on instagram or passively consuming recommended YouTube videos as immoral.
It is not bad to produce nothing or learn nothing for a few minutes on a random day, but it is costly to let it become a habit.
Costly in time and in opportunity.
I don’t believe I’m particularly special but I do think there is a version of me at eightysomething years old that looks back with some sastifaction at his life’s work.
I want to do something meaningful and I know the steady progress of minutes hours and days can lead to things that irregular bouts of inspiration can imagine but never produce.</p></div>

  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">

    <div class="paragraph"><p>I anticipate confusion regarding the name of this site.
How is it a book?
<!--more-->
Sure, it abides by the criteria of a socalled <a id="2023-08-11-virtual-book" class="" href="/vbook/virtual-book">virtual book</a> – multimedia, readerdriven, nonlinear, etc – but it’s still basically just a blog, isn’t it?</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Granted, this is not a book.
Not yet.
But over time, it may become one.
In fact I hope it will become multiple, overlapping books.
I intend to accumulate relevant and complementary content without prescribing a single vision or intention for it so that it can take a shape of its own.
<em>Shapes</em> of its own.
At points in the future I may be able to collect multiple pieces into discrete, booklike forms.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>It’s been two years since I began this project and already emerging are various potential booklike projects.
An obvious one is compiling posts from a title series like <a id="2023-05-09-revise-a-sentence" class="" href="/vbook/revise-a-sentence"><em>how to revise a sentence</em></a>, <a id="2023-06-05-revise-a-sentence-2" class="" href="/vbook/revise-a-sentence-2"><em>#2</em></a>, <a id="2024-10-12-revise-a-sentence-3" class="" href="/vbook/revise-a-sentence-3"><em>#3</em></a>, <a id="2024-11-28-revise-a-sentence-4" class="" href="/vbook/revise-a-sentence-4"><em>#4</em></a>, and so on, into a single work.
Naturally, other pieces tagged as <a href="/vbook/tags/writing">#writing</a> would make good candidates for inclusion in that work.
The same for <a id="2022-06-11-tell-a-story" class="" href="/vbook/tell-a-story"><em>how to tell a story</em></a>, <a id="2022-06-11-tell-a-story-2" class="" href="/vbook/tell-a-story-2"><em>#2</em></a>, <a id="2024-08-12-tell-a-story-3" class="" href="/vbook/tell-a-story-3"><em>#3</em></a>, and future entries.
These titles are intentionally broad so they can hold a variety of perspectives on the topic that may later be combined to serve unforeseen ends.
I expect that any such attempts will prompt me to write new material that fuses all the pieces together, thereby creating a seamless new whole.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>But that’s only one way in which I want “books” to develop from this site.
I also want them to sprout organically from the haphazard crosspollination of ideas that features like tagging and backlinking enable.
I recently implemented another feature called revisions – which I talked about in my Sept 30th 2024 <a id="2024-09-30-now" class="" href="/vbook/now-sept-30-2024">/now</a> update – that adds yet another dimension through which a reader (including myself) can traverse the content on this site.
Automation is a powerful way to highlight implicit relationships that already exist between pieces.
They enable unplanned connections to grow across topics and time.
The next feature I intend to automate is a simple and intuitive one: links between posts in a title series.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>It’s fitting that this site itself is the fusion product of <a id="2023-02-25-come.up.with.ideas" class="" href="/vbook/come-up-with-ideas">various heterogenous inspirations</a>.
As I’ve said before, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten">Zettelkasten method</a> of knowledge management is one of them.
The method, as noted by researcher Andy Matuschak on his own <a href="https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zDcuS8A5uxGR8hQygsqP83A">Zettelkasten-inspired website</a>, enabled Germany sociologist Niklas Luhmann to publish more than 70 books.
My writing ambitions are far more modest, but I am interested in adapting the method into a way of writing “books” <em>directly</em>, as opposed to its original purpose of amassing research into a network of information that may then be synthesized and captured in newly written prose.
I want to <em>start</em> by writing prose in small chunks and see if the resulting pieces can themselves comprise a booklike thing.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>And yet the point of this site is not to become a book, but to provide booklike experiences <a id="2023-08-11-virtual-book" class="" href="/vbook/virtual-book">without subjecting itself to the traditional limits</a> of a book.
The point is not merely to create books through piecemeal writing, but also to offer pieces by themselves and as an assortment of nonlinear orderings, unlike the offering of the traditional book: single, linear, and monolithic.
This site is not just a means but an end itself.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Finally, I want to say that, despite all this, I don’t look at books with contempt or ungratefulness.
I love books.
They have changed my life for the better and I’d like to return the favor.</p></div>

Craig is not the first technologist-writer whose site I’ve encountered recently.
I also found <a href="https://www.robinsloan.com/">robinsloan.com</a> and <a href="https://jsomers.net/">jsomers.net</a>, both of whom are accomplished writers and experienced programmers.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Although personal sites are perhaps the most exciting, there are also some great ones run by organizations.
The most special of these is probably <a href="https://www.capitolhillseattle.com/">Capitol Hill Seattle Blog</a>, a neighborhood blog turned crowdsourced news site turned indepedent and ultralocal news site.
It’s special not only because it is independent but because it offers volumes of dense and specific information about a focused locale.
I’m yet to find anything else like it.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I also used to be a big fan of <a href="https://pudding.cool">pudding.cool</a>, but lately have lost some of my enthusiasm for them because they seem to pick topics for novelty and appeal.
They are perhaps more an entertainment company than a journalism firm.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I often come across new sites and I like to save them here to remind myself to check back on them and consider adding them to the small set of sites I frequent.
Here are sites that haven’t made it into my special list but I want to revisit soon:</p></div>
