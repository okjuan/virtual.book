    <div class="paragraph"><p>I‚Äôve been losing weight, playing soccer, developing this site, reading books, and more.
<!--more--></p></div>

<h3 id="life">Life</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Preparing green card papers for my wife, Z.
We probably won‚Äôt get them until early 2025.
<em>Sigh</em>.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Enjoying the fall.
Except for the short days.
Sun sets at 4:30pm nowadays.
Blehj.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Playing soccer.
I‚Äôve noticed in the last several months that I‚Äôm scoring more goals from longer range, 20+ yards away from goal.
I‚Äôm delighted that it‚Äôs turning out to be one of my strengths in the game.
I‚Äôd gotten used to thinking that headers and penalties were my only goal-scoring strengths.
(And, actually, I‚Äôve gotten worse at penalties in the last several years.)
I think I‚Äôm reaping the benefits of the hours I spent in my late teens (and perhaps early twenties) practicing long-range shooting.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Losing weight.
I‚Äôve lost ~11lbs in the last 5 months, an average of 2.2lbs per month.
If I can keep up that rate, I‚Äôll reach my goal weight of 189lbs in 13.6 months.
Geez, that‚Äôs January 20<em>25</em>.
Sounds like early 2025 will be cathartic time for me.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I‚Äôve noticed my attitude towards money has shifted recently.
For years, I‚Äôve wanted to keep open the option of taking a major career risk, so I wanted to save as much as possible.
But nowadays, I‚Äôm pretty happy and could see myself staying at Microsoft for a few more years, at least.
I am fortunate that money is not a scarce resource for me and I can use it to save time and make my life better.
I still try not to overspend, but I don‚Äôt let it dominate my decisions as much anymore.</p></div>

<h3 id="travel">Travel</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Went to Mexico with Z:
Ixtapa, Mexico City, Queretaro, and San Miguel de Allende.</p></div>

<h3 id="coding">Coding</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Mainly working on this site, <a href="/vbook/">okjuan.me/vbook</a>.
It‚Äôs been tricky because I don‚Äôt know any Ruby and don‚Äôt want to invest time into learning it right now.
So far, I‚Äôve gotten by on documentation and other people‚Äôs examples.
Most recently, I added backlinks, with some <a href="https://www.daniel.industries/2023/01/29/really-basic-backlinks-in-jekyll/">help from Daniel Miller</a>.
I also made tags the main way to navigate the site by folding ‚Äòcategories‚Äô into them.
Not only is this cleaner and more uniform, but it also allows me to assign multiple categories (now tags) to the same post.
For example, a post can now be ‚Äòfiled‚Äô under both <a href="/vbook/tags/essays/">#essays</a> and <a href="/vbook/tags/journal/">#journal</a>.
See <a href="https://www.mentalnodes.com/folders-kill-creativity">Folders kill creativity</a>.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I still really want to make and deploy a front-end for <a href="https://github.com/okjuan/music-lib-bot">music-lib-bot</a>.
A web app would make sense, but I also like the idea of an SMS interface or something of the like.
Maybe even something integrated into Google Assistant.</p></div>

<h3 id="writing">Writing</h3>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Focused on posting here, <a href="/vbook/">okjuan.me/vbook</a>.
Not working on anything for <a href="https://okjuan.medium.com/">okjuan.medium.com</a> or <a href="https://okjuan.substack.com/">okjuan.substack.com</a>, although I can <a href="https://okjuan.substack.com/p/learning-to-dress">cross-post</a> like I did for </p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/clothes">learning to dress</a><p>.
Nothing currently in the works for <a href="https://www.206zulu.org/author/juan-carlos-gallegos/">206 Zulu</a> either.
I worked on a second piece for them earlier this year, but that stalled.
Ended up posting it </p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/metier-brewing">here</a><p>.</p>

<h3 id="reading">Reading</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I just finished 2 books: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43306206-the-courage-to-be-disliked">The Courage to be Disliked</a> by Ichiro Kishimi and Fumitake Koga and <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52386552-into-the-abyss">Into the Abyss: A Neuropsychiatrist‚Äôs Notes on Troubled Minds</a> by Anthony David.
<em>The Courage</em> was thought-provoking and written in a novel form.
See Derek Sivers‚Äô <a href="https://sive.rs/book/Disliked">notes</a> on it.
<em>Into the Abyss</em> was full of fascinating cases and some good insight.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Recently read Anthony Lane‚Äôs hilarious New Yorker article, <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/10/23/build-the-life-you-want-the-art-and-science-of-getting-happier-oprah-winfrey-and-arthur-c-brooks-book-review">Can Happiness Be Taught?</a>
It‚Äôs a review of recent best-seller <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/137978862-build-the-life-you-want">Build the Life You Want: The Art and Science of Getting Happier</a>, written by a Professor of Management Practice at Harvard Business School and sponsored by Oprah Winfrey.
One of my favorite bits:</p></div>

<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>‚Ä¶imperative reigns supreme. ‚ÄúStart by working on your toughness.‚Äù No sweat. ‚ÄúTake your grand vision of improvement and humble ambition to be part of it in a specific way and execute accordingly.‚Äù Check. ‚ÄúRebel against your shame.‚Äù Done. ‚ÄúWiden your conflict-resolution repertoire.‚Äù Ka-pow! ‚ÄúTreat your walks, prayer time, and gym sessions as if they were meetings with the president.‚Äù Which President? ‚ÄúJournal your experiences and feelings over the course of the day.‚Äù Since when did ‚Äújournal‚Äù turn into a transitive verb? ‚ÄúDig into the extensive and growing technology and literature on mindfulness.‚Äù Sorry, I was miles away, what? Above all, ‚ÄúRemember: You are your own CEO.‚Äù Holy moly. Do I have to wear a suit to brush my teeth? Is my dog a shareholder? Were last year‚Äôs migraines tax-deductible? Can I be fired by me?</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Last month, I read the first part of Jane Jacobs‚Äô famous <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30833.The_Death_and_Life_of_Great_American_Cities">The Death and Life of Great American Cities</a>.
To my surprise, it‚Äôs great so far.
I expected it to be much drier, as I‚Äôm sure many books about city and neighborhood planning are.
I bought a copy and intend to read it over the next couple months.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>While traveling in Mexico, I read a bit of <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29358301-vital-little-plans">Vital Little Plans: The Short Works of Jane Jacobs</a>.
It was really good, too.
Not sure if I‚Äôll be able to continue though.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Last month I started listening to Stephen King‚Äôs </p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/on-writing">On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft</a><p> and was surprised at how entertaining it was.
I might keep listening.
I like reading </p>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Last month (whew!) I also read a bit of Gloria Steinem‚Äôs <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/335090.Revolution_from_Within">Revolution from Within</a>, which I found on one of my dutiful visits to my local Goodwill.
It‚Äôs pretty interesting.
The story about the Royal Knights of East Harlem was really moving.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I plan to listen to another chunk of <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61153739-outlive">Outlive: The Science and Art of Longevity</a> to get some health tips.

<h3 id="tv">TV</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>The Sopranos for the second time.
Amazed at the writing, once again.
They follow so many characters and develop so many dynamics at the same time.
Many story lines don‚Äôt build to a climax and exist instead to develop characters and prepare future story lines.
Some just exist because they‚Äôre true to life.
Like when Carmela and Tony struggle to keep their rebellious daughter in check.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Couples Therapy, season 3.
So insightful and fascinating.
Orna is an amazing therapist.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Welcome to Wrexham, season 2.
I don‚Äôt think any other show has made me cry as much as this one, and I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs because I love soccer so much.
The show has so much heart.</p></div>

<h3 id="movies">Movies</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Rewatched Roma and Coco with my wife, who hadn‚Äôt seen either, while we were in Mexico.
I love doing activities that thematically or topically match other things I‚Äôm doing in life.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>It has encouraged me to review the ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs Next?‚Äù section to see what intentions I had a month or two prior.

    <div class="paragraph"><p>Hunched against the cold in our hotel bathrobes and slippers we crunched over the snow between the pools, looking for the hottest one.

Of course, it turned out to be the one everyone was crowded into.
For a few hours we crouched in the hot water avoiding eye contact with the multitude around us ‚Äì a family reunion, couples on anniversary weekend getaways ‚Äì trying to convince Z‚Äôs mom and stepdad that renting was a <a href="https://macwright.com/2023/12/21/homeownership">better option than buying</a> in their current circumstances.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>In the evening Z and I went for drinks and dessert at the hotel‚Äôs lounge, The Copper Room.
We sat among the other couples at one of the cloth-draped tables surrounding the big empty dance floor.
The waiter glided from table to table cracking jokes with his head cocked.
The band started playing another oldie and a couple in their thirties came out onto the dance floor.
They danced clumnsily near the edge of the hardwood rectangle, far from the stage, near our section of tables.
The man smiled blankly as he tried leading his partner, who was grinning in embarrassment and bowing her head while she went through the motions.
I suppose we shouldn‚Äôt have been surprised when she took a tumble, such was the lack of coordination between all components ‚Äì music, limbs, lovers.
They scuttled off the dance floor only to creep back on a couple songs later to join the couples they‚Äôd inspired onto their feet.</p></div>

    <div class="paragraph"><p>Our roommate started dating our neighbor a couple months ago and it‚Äôs going great.
<!--more-->
I suppose it‚Äôs not a common situation, but living nextdoor to each other is a natural way for strangers to meet, especially when one has a puppy.
Nothing breaks the ice like a cute dog.
Despite this, it took months of hallway chats and run-ins outside the building before anything happened.
In that time, my roommate went on dates with a few different people, but none of them caused the blushing grin our neighbor eventually did.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>It‚Äôs good you moved in with us, I joked.
But it‚Äôs probably true that they would‚Äôve never dated if she hadn‚Äôt moved into our spare bedroom.
And she wasn‚Äôt supposed to!
We had another roommate lined up, but he backed out.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Of course, this is only one of many <em>ifs</em>.
She would‚Äôve never moved in if we hadn‚Äôt met her through my wife‚Äôs Bumble BFF friend, who my wife only met because she was visiting me so frequently in Seattle.
And my wife would‚Äôve never been in Seattle to befriend anyone if I hadn‚Äôt stayed in Victoria for the summer of 2020, which only happened because of a global pandemic called Covid-19.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Before they lay their roots so many of the stable and essential elements of our lives come into them through the most tenuous strands of chance and circumstance.
It can seem corny or gimmicky to muse about the unlikeliness of life, but it‚Äôs useful to consider because it‚Äôs true.
As your life progresses, the array of people you may become shrinks and narrows until finally there are no more possibilities.
You can‚Äôt live more than one life, but you can live as a number of people, various versions of yourself.
Who those people are depends much on luck, but also on the opportunities of transformation to which you offer yourself.
It isn‚Äôt just design and foresight we need in order to realize ourselves, but knowledge and acceptance of our susceptibility to external forces and the resulting courage to toss ourselves into the fire and let it forge of us what it will.</p></div>

    <div class="paragraph"><p>As I walk through cities nowadays I try to look through a <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/The_Death_and_Life_of_Great_American_Cities">Jane Jacobian</a> lens at the diversity of enterprise and use about.
<!--more-->
By <em>use</em>, Jacobs literally means the uses buildings provide: living, working, commerce, diversion, to name some of the main ones.
Nowadays it‚Äôs easy to take for granted mixed-use buildings, but they exist because the city planning orthodoxy of today ‚Äì which Jacobs influenced through her writing and activism ‚Äì makes space for them.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Mixing of uses is only one of the ingredients that Jacobs argues districts must employ to generate lively and diverse city life.
Another one is short blocks, to allow foot traffic from adjacent streets.
On a recent walk, I noticed how much was packed onto one side of a short city block on one of the lively stretches of East Hastings in East Vancouver.
A gym offering <em>luxury fight goods and apparel</em>, a plant shop, a laundry service business, a kitchen renovation business, a small counterservice cafe offering ‚ÄúItalian street food‚Äù, a nail studio, a print shop, a beauty salon, a travel agency, an importer‚Äôs office, a Vietnamese restaurant, and a hip diner.
Most of these on the ground level of a three-storey residential building occupying much of the block.
On the corner past the diner a vacant lot recently bulldozed in preparation for a four-storey mixed-use residential building.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>A fifteen minute walk away begins the vibrant stretch of Commercial Drive, one of the liveliest areas of East Vancouver.
Near its north tip, for example, there‚Äôs a gallery, a secondhand clothing shop, a shop for local art, and a coworking space, all in the same building and all apparently run by the <a href="https://www.slicevancouver.ca/">same collective</a>, which hosts events including stand up comedy nights and craft workshops in the gallery and coworking space.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Diversity is possible in cities, Jane Jacobs explains, because they bring together people in quantities so great that critical mass can be reached for projects and enterprises that can‚Äôt survive in sparser and less diverse communities.
But for diversity to flourish and thrive, cities must create and maintain four key conditions: mixing of use, short blocks, buildings of varying age, and population density.</p></div>

    <div class="paragraph"><p>Walking on a late evening on my own I passed a theatre I knew nothing about.
<!--more-->
I looked up what shows they had coming up and saw that Vieux Farka Tour√© was playing that week.
I confirmed that he was the artist who had released a collaborative album with Khruangbin and mulled over buying tickets before realizing it was sold out.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>While working the next day I listened to his KEXP live studio performance.
It sounded great.
On the day of the show, I called the theatre a couple times and managed to snag a couple tickets.
Z and I went, and it was amazing.
His band was the same as in the KEXP live performance: a bassist, a percussionist, and Vieux Farka Tour√© on guitar and vocals.
All the instruments sounded great, especially the percussion and the guitar, but best of all was Vieux Farka Tour√©‚Äôs voice.
I‚Äôve since returned to <em>Ali</em>, his album with Khruangbin, and confirmed that it doesn‚Äôt do his voice justice.
Live it was spellbinding.</p></div>

    <div class="paragraph"><p>I wrote an essay called <a href="https://okjuan.medium.com/the-virtual-book-part-1-782ccd4cc360">The Virtual Book</a> but I never defined the term.
<!--more-->
By virtual book I mean a book unbound by the traditional and physical constraints of printed books.
I say ‚Äòvirtual‚Äô because the greatest possibilities I see are in the virtual world of computers.
Ebooks and audiobooks are just the beginning.
The possibilities that excite me challenge not only the physicality of books but also their more subtle attributes.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>A virtual book can be <strong>multimedia</strong>.
It can consist of words, images, video, audio.
There, we got the obvious one out of the way.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>A virtual book can be <strong>readerdriven</strong>.
Instead of forcing readers to follow the author‚Äôs thought process, a virtual book can let each reader steer the way.
Wikipedia does this already.
It lets you search the page for keywords, skip to the section you‚Äôre interested in, and even escape into a tangential topic, never to return.
This is a natural way to consume Wikipedia because its form <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Affordance">affords</a> it.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Books generally have one start and one ending, but a virtual book can be <strong>nonlinear</strong>.
Wikipedia is again the obvious example.
But letting the reader drive is only one way to create a nonlinear book.
It‚Äôs also possible to create multiple entrypoints, or even multiple endings, like <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Black_Mirror:_Bandersnatch">Black Mirror: Bandersnatch</a>.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>A virtual book can be <strong>dynamic</strong>.
It can change after its initial creation.
Printed books, on the other hand, are static snapshots laboriously rendered by a particular author at a particular time.
But what if a theory is debunked?
Or a hypothesis confirmed?
Or a record shattered?
Or, in the case of storytelling, what if a loose end can be tied up neatly?</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>A virtual book can be <strong>nonmonolithic</strong>.
It does not need to be discrete or selfcontained.
It can consist of many interconnected parts that make up the whole but can exist without it.
It can reference other virtual books, borrow bits from them, and lend bits of its own.
For example, if Herbie Hancock‚Äôs memoir was a virtual audiobook, it could allow its snippets to be reconstrued into a documentary about jazz.
(If Ken Burns‚Äô Jazz documentary series was also ‚Äòvirtualized‚Äô, it could have been updated 15 years after its release to include bits of Herbie‚Äôs narration.)
In fact, it could provide material for documentaries about many different topics: jazz, funk, hip hop, Miles Davis, Black Nationalism, Nichiren Buddhism, meditation, and crack addictions, to name some of the obvious ones.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>A virtual book can be <strong>responsive</strong>.
What if a reader could expect a book to field spontaneous questions?
ChatGPT is an obvious candidate here, but the possibility is broader.
What if Herbie Hancock returned to his memoir every now and then to answer questions that readers had left behind while reading it?
What if readers could raise flags on issues that factcheckers would then verify or return to the author for amendment?</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>The possibilities are plenty, and they are thrilling.
The difficulty in realizating them is not technological, but legal and political.
Powerful companies ‚Äì and therefore governments ‚Äì are hugely incentivized to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Swartz">prevent the free exchange of ‚Äúintellectual property‚Äù</a>.
To make virtual books possible, we need not only the technological power of software, but also its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons">progressive politics</a>.</p></div>
