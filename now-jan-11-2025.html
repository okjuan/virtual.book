<h4 id="saturday-12212024--sunday-12222024--tokyo-first-time-at-an-izakaya">Saturday 12/21/2024 / Sunday 12/22/2024 – Tokyo, first time at an izakaya</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Z &amp; I flew @ 12:45pm directly from Vancouver (YVR) -&gt; Tokyo (NRT)</li>
  <li>Z slept while the rest of us ate at a nearby izakaya (drinks, raw tuna, cheese pancakes, potato croquettes, chicken karaage, etc.)</li>
  <li>chocolate ice cream bar at 7 Eleven on the way back to the hotel</li>
</ul>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Z &amp; I flew with Air Canada.
We upgraded to Premium Economy to avoid being stuck in a couple of middle seats.
It was expensive, but it made our flight much better.
I spent the whole flight reading and writing.
I read the first 150 pages of <em>Normal People</em> and </p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/normal-people">wrote about it</a><p>, pausing only to eat meals.
I couldn’t believe it when it was announced that we were beginning our descent.</p>
</div>

<h4 id="monday-12232024--tokyo-a-day-of-shopping">Monday 12/23/2024 – Tokyo, a day of shopping</h4>

<ul>
  <li>solo coffee nearby while Z &amp; my family ate breakfast at the hotel</li>
  <li>together took train to Shibuya City, then ate at a good conveyor belt sushi restaurant</li>
  <li>solo flat white @ The Roastery by Nozy Coffee on Cat Street</li>
  <li>solo browse MoMA Design Store &amp; other boutiques, bought tea towel from Hay</li>
  <li>solo walk thru Shibuya, fatigued from jetlag, got another coffee</li>
  <li>solo browsed robe store but did not find what I wanted</li>
  <li>with group again, bought hoodie @ Carhartt Work In Progress store</li>
  <li>bought shoes and slides @ Hoka store</li>
  <li>visit Tadao Ando’s public bathroom in Jingū-dōri Park, which was featured in the movie <em>Perfect Days</em>
</li>
  <li>Shibuya crossing! then very spicy ramen at a place with weird vibes</li>
</ul>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I had severe allergies until the early evening.
This happens to me whenever I travel somewhere new.
In 2017 I went to Europe for the first time and I spent the first full day sneezing and oozing.
Same thing this time in Tokyo for the first 24 hours.
Reactine didn’t seem to make a difference, just had to wait it out.</p></div>

<h4 id="tuesday-12242024--tokyo">Tuesday 12/24/2024 – Tokyo</h4>

<ul>
  <li>arrived at Disney Sea @ 12pm</li>
  <li>rode on lots of rides, walked a lot, listened to Disney Xmas carollers</li>
  <li>subpar pizza &amp; pasta in Little Venice</li>
  <li>explored the rest of the park, rode on more rides, fought jetlag</li>
  <li>left @ 9pm, closing time</li>
</ul>

<div class="paragraph"><p>The architecture and spatial planning of the theme park was really impressive.
It seemed like every corner we rounded we encountered another stridebreaking view of the park.
It reminded me of the architectural tactic of constraining the height and width of hallways to reinforce the impact of emerging into a bigger space.
It’s a method that’s been employed by Tadao Ando of Osaka and other famous architects like Frank Lloyd Wright.</p></div>

<h4 id="wednesday-12252024--tokyo">Wednesday 12/25/2024 – Tokyo</h4>

<ul>
  <li>solo walk through the Shimbashi area getting a couple of coffees</li>
  <li>Z &amp; I explored Ebisu on foot, stopping at a puppy store and a pharmacy</li>
  <li>cocktails @ bar EAS MOR, which had great atmosphere</li>
  <li>visited mall briefly, then dinner @ Toki Taruza withe everyone</li>
  <li>7 Eleven for snacks on the way to the hotel</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="thursday-12262024--tokyo---takayama">Thursday 12/26/2024 – Tokyo -&gt; Takayama</h4>

<ul>
  <li>get two flat whites from INCredible Coffee</li>
  <li>took bullet train @ 1pm to Takayama via Nagoya</li>
  <li>dinner at a nice sushi restaurant</li>
  <li>fell asleep by 9pm, finally cured my jetlag</li>
</ul>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Tokyo station was huge and very busy.
It felt like being in a beehive.
It took me and Z a while to figure out how to pick up our tickets.
One machine gave us an error message but then we tried a machine in a different section and it worked.
Then we circled through the masses, trying to figure out which screen listed our train’s platform.
When we finally found it, we struggled to pass through the gate.
Z put in the two tickets as the ticket machine had instructed but that wasn’t enough.
We had a confusing interaction with a worker there, who we finally understood was saying to scan our IC card after inserting the tickets.
We made it through and with thirty minutes left until departure time, we lined up to buy food and drinks to take onto the train.
It’s good we came an hour early.</p></div>

<h4 id="friday-12272024--takayama">Friday 12/27/2024 – Takayama</h4>

<ul>
  <li>while Z had breakfast at the hotel, I walked into town and had coffee @ Brand New Day and then @ Hids’ Cafe</li>
  <li>at Miyagawa Morning Markets we bought a beef bun, a fridge magnet, two pairs of chopsticks, and two ceramic mugs</li>
  <li>pop into a cutlery store and then have lunch &amp; coffee @ Ember coffee in beautiful 150+ yearold house</li>
  <li>walk up hill to Shoren-ji Temple, enjoying the snowy scenery</li>
  <li>back in town, stop at stationery store</li>
  <li>I bought a yukata at a kimono store</li>
  <li>dinner @ ramen restaurant</li>
  <li>incredible cocktails @ Yu</li>
  <li>thirty minutes in a private onsen w/ Z at the hotel</li>
</ul>

<div class="paragraph"><p>This was one of the best days of the trip.</p></div>

<h4 id="saturday-12282024--takayama---shirakawago---kanazawa">Saturday 12/28/2024 – Takayama -&gt; Shirakawago -&gt; Kanazawa</h4>

<ul>
  <li>solo walk over fresh snow into town for coffee @ Falò Coffee Brewers, then got cash from post office ATM, then coffee @ Ember, before returning to hotel</li>
  <li>we took the bus to Shirakawago</li>
  <li>delicious snacks and drinks from window shop on street</li>
  <li>walk through village, across pedestrian bridge over the river, to the museum, and then back</li>
  <li>coffees &amp; Baum stick</li>
  <li>we took the bus to Kanazawa, then food &amp; drinks @ Pari King nearby</li>
  <li>beer &amp; instant ramen in the hotel room</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="sunday-12292024--kanazawa">Sunday 12/29/2024 – Kanazawa</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Z &amp; I had breakfast &amp; coffee at Isotope Coffee, a beautiful space</li>
  <li>solo stroll through town listening to music and taking pictures</li>
  <li>drank coffee and <a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/normal-people">wrote about <em>Normal People</em></a><p> at Townsfolk Coffee</p>
</li>
  <li>Z met me and we walked north through Omigi Market for dinner at a fine dining restaurant called Barrier</li>
  <li>we walked through the Higashi Chaya District</li>
  <li>Z went to the Kanzawa Forus mall and I sat at a small pub to read <em>Normal People</em> &amp; drink beer</li>
  <li>we had cocktails at Furansu Cocktail Bar, which bartender at Yu in Takayama had recommended</li>
  <li>bites and drinks at Izakaya Hanagumi</li>
  <li>spent the rest of the night at Donuts Music Bar</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="monday-12302024--kanazawa">Monday 12/30/2024 – Kanazawa</h4>

<ul>
  <li>breakfast &amp; coffee at Moron Cafe</li>
  <li>visit beautiful Samurai house with an exquisite garden and a small gallery of artifacts</li>
  <li>coffee @ Townsfolk Coffee, then a brief stop at a combini store</li>
  <li>walk through to Oyama Shrine, through gardens, up to Kanazawa Castle ruins, down past Kenroku-en Garden</li>
  <li>Z took the bus to the Kanzawa Forus mall and I walked through Shiinoki Green Space back to the hotel</li>
  <li>I rested &amp; read <em>Normal People</em> in the room</li>
  <li>met Z for dinner nearby, but Love For All’s kitchen was closed so we went to The Cottage</li>
  <li>stop at Lawson, then back to hotel</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="tuesday-12312024--kanazawa---tokyo">Tuesday 12/31/2024 – Kanazawa -&gt; Tokyo</h4>

<ul>
  <li>tax to train station, where we ate and waited for our train</li>
  <li>arrived in Tokyo, train to Shimbashi, checked back into the hotel</li>
  <li>rested a couple hours at the hotel</li>
  <li>dinner @ Daigo, a fancy Shojin restaurant</li>
  <li>karaoke @ Big Echo</li>
</ul>

<div class="paragraph"><p>A thunderstorm began while we were in a taxi on the way to the Kanazawa train station.
Flashes of lightning so bright I thought for a moment our driver had run a red light and triggered a super powerful automated stoplight camera.
We tried a coffee shop near the train station but it was closed for New Years, which is the biggest national holiday in Japan.
Train station was full of stores and flooded with white overhead lighting.
Cruel Summer by Taylor Swift playing in the overhead speakers.
We sat in Tully’s Coffee lounge with our bags piled around our ankles.
On the far wall a horribly sappy and nonsensical marketing poem for <em>&amp; Tea</em>.
I felt like I could be in any other manufactured commercial center around the world.
Soulless places like these often have this sort interchangeability, lack of identity.
Being there, it doesn’t feel like you’re in an actual <em>place</em>.
You’re just temporarily detained in a massproduced commercial limbo.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Grateful to be back in the sun.</p></div>

<h4 id="wednesday-01012024--tokyo">Wednesday 01/01/2024 – Tokyo</h4>

<ul>
  <li>coffee &amp; breakfast @ Starbucks</li>
  <li>visit fancy mall where teamLABS is</li>
  <li>watched Gladiator II @ 109 Cinemas</li>
  <li>ramen dinner nearby</li>
</ul>

<div class="paragraph"><p>It was certainly a mistake to visit Japan in the first few days of January.
As noted all over the internet, New Years is Japan’s major national holiday and many things close not only on the first but for a week.
I’m sure Z would’ve determined this if we had been more involved in planning the trip.
Lesson learned, I suppose.</p></div>

<h4 id="thursday-01022024--tokyo">Thursday 01/02/2024 – Tokyo</h4>

<ul>
  <li>visit various neighborhoods including Gakugei-daigaku, Naka-meguro, &amp; Ebisu</li>
  <li>visited two more Tokyo Toilet locations, designed by Masamichi Katayama &amp;	Kashiwa Satō</li>
  <li>incredible sushi @ Standing Sushi Nemuro Hanamaru in Ginza</li>
  <li>shop @ UNIQLO Flagship store</li>
  <li>cocktails @ La France in Ginza</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="friday-01032024--tokyo">Friday 01/03/2024 – Tokyo</h4>

<ul>
  <li>visit Tokyo National Museum</li>
  <li>lunch &amp; coffee there</li>
  <li>Hello Kitty special exhibition and gift shop</li>
  <li>visit Senso-ji temple w/ Z</li>
  <li>solo walk in Asakusa area</li>
  <li>dinner w/ my friend H @ Monja Shichigosan then drinks at nearby pub</li>
</ul>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>I had </p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/context">mixed feelings about the museum</a><p>.
Or, I don’t know, maybe I just needed a meal.
Or a better sleep.
Or to feel like I chose to go there.
Or to have had a period earlier in the day where I’d gotten to direct my attention to things of my choosing.
Or a period to produce something, so that I might be in a more </p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/chart-moods">absorptive mood</a><p>.
That certainly makes me feel better about socializing aimlessly in the evening, when I feel like I’ve done something productive with my day.</p>
</div>

<h4 id="saturday-01042024--tokyo">Saturday 01/04/2024 – Tokyo</h4>

<ul>
  <li>solo coffee &amp; journaling @ City Bakery</li>
  <li>teppanyaki dinner w/ my mom on top floor of mall in Ginza</li>
  <li>visit the teamLAB Borderless Digital Art Museum</li>
</ul>

<div class="paragraph"><p>The Digital Art Museum was really cool.
It was a dark maze on the bottom floor of a fancy mall where myriad projectors shone moving patterns and images of light on walls, floors, and ceilings.
This by itself might’ve been a gimmicky socialmedia tourist trap, but embedded throughout the large labyrinthine gallery were rooms where sculptural elements combined with light, music, and mirrors to create surreal experiences.</p></div>

<h4 id="sunday-01052024--tokyo---vancouver">Sunday 01/05/2024 – Tokyo -&gt; Vancouver</h4>

<ul>
  <li>check out but leave bags at hotel</li>
  <li>solo cortado from Brooklyn Roasters in Ginza</li>
  <li>solo browse flea market &amp; buy orange tinted glass to use for cappuccinos at home</li>
  <li>pick up bags at hotel and take train to Narita</li>
  <li>flew directly @ 6pm from Tokyo (NRT) -&gt; Vancouver (YVR)</li>
</ul>

<div class="paragraph"><p>My intention was to browse Hands and Itoya in Ginza, but I came across the flea market when I stopped for coffee by Ginza station.
There were dozens of stalls selling ceramics, porcelain, kimonos, jackets, bluedyed fabrics, and so on.
The orange tinted glass I bought was only 400 yen, less than three dollars in USD, and I could see it selling for tens times the amount at trendy stores in the USA and Canada.
I’m still sour about going to the East Vancouver “Flea Market” to find they charge an <em>admission fee</em> and sell priced up secondhand and vintagestyled clothing.</p></div>
</div>
<a class="u-url" href="/vbook/japan-trip" hidden></a>
</article>

      </div>
    </div></div><p>.
I would love to live there for a while someday, although I think it unlikely, even though they offer a six month Digital Nomad visa.
Z’s work is not remote and she wants to develop her career, so teaching English or something of the sort is not particularly useful to her.
Regardless, I am sure we will visit again.</p></div>

<h3 id="losing-weight">losing weight</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I am twenty pounds lighter than I was a year and a half ago.
I still want to lose another twenty.
I am trying to eat very consciously and exercise everyday.
I feel optimistic.</p></div>

<h3 id="experimenting-with-daily-routines">experimenting with daily routines</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>For the last few days I have woken up early and immediately gone out on a walk with my coffee.
It’s a lovely way to warm up for the day and start by accomplishing my daily task of exercising.
Walking is useful for me given that I am a homebody with a remote computer job and a reliance on soccer for exercise.
After returning from my morning walks I’ve spent some time reading before getting on with my day.
An aspiration I’ve set for myself is to do each of these everyday: exercise, read, write, work, enjoy, socialize, discuss, grow, &amp; plan.
I realize they might sound cheesy, but they are distillations of more specific intentions I have for 2025.</p></div>

<h3 id="working">working</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>In December I received my expected promotion to Senior Software Engineer.
It’s a milestone in my career.
The pay bump was nice if modest for industry standards, but the biggest perk is the deference I am already getting as part of the increase in my responsibilities.
I have strong opinions on how certain things should be done and I feel already a boost in persuasive power generated from my new title.
To summarize, I feel like I have more agency, and I welcome it.</p></div>

    <div class="paragraph">
<p>I heartily agree with Crawford’s emphasis on the importance of embodied experiences and his warning that virtual worlds can promote passivity, technology as magic, and false agency.
<!--more-->
<em>However</em>.
I am also very enthusiastic about technological tools as real tools and virtual worlds as deeply enriching.
Consider books for example.
They are a virtual, symbolic world of their own and were object of </p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/end-of-absence">moral panic</a><p> in their own time.
But I think most of us would consider them indispensable now.
Books are fictions divorced from physicality, but is that inherently bad?
I don’t think so.</p>
</div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I am several chapters in but already think Crawford’s argument needs work.
His critique of “representations” and “abstractions” needs a lot more development in my opinion.
I’d invoke him to reflect on his own life to rebalance his argument: he loves to ride motorcycles and fix them up, but he also loves to read books and write them.
Surely he needs to make space for symbolic experiences alongside physical ones?
I say this despite agreeing with his insight on the surprising hollowness of Choice as Freedom and the way resource-extractive corporations exploit this to harvest wealth from consumers.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>All in all I think he makes some fantastic, nuanced points but builds a shaky overarching argument from it.
I would love to him to take a second crack at it.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p><em>I originally wrote the above <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/o6efsb/comment/m0yv7mk/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">on Reddit</a> after reading the first half the book.</em></p></div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>As I’ve said </p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/now-jan-11-2025">else</a><p></p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/2024">where</a><p>, I really appreciated that this book resisted taking the reactionary stance against technology as inherently insidious and unavoidably corruptive of our psychological wellbeing.
In the epilogue, Crawford summarizes his alternative critique of technology’s role in leeching on our attention:</p>
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>The problem…of distraction…is usually discussed as a problem of technology. I [suggest] we view the problem as more fundamentally one of political economy. In a culture saturated with technologies for appropriating our attention, our interior mental lives are laid bare as a resource to be harvested by others. Viewing it this way shifts our gaze from the technology itself to the intention that guides its design and its dissemination into every area of life.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>This perspective excites me not just because it rings truer but also because it prevents indiscriminate rejection of technology and instead makes possible a judicious trust that allows us to make good use of it.</p></div>

    <div class="paragraph"><p>From where I am sitting on my balcony I can see the TV out of the corner of my eye and it’s very difficult to ignore it.
<!--more-->
I keep turning my head away to think of what to write next, but then when I turn back to resume typing on my computer, the flashes of color and light from the TV make it very difficult for me to focus.
I just went inside and turned it off, but still my mind keeps diverting attention to the now black rectangle in my peripheral vision.
Let me draw the curtains.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Sometimes when I want to be alone I come out and sit here.
It’s a lovely little space detached from the living room.
However, if Z is sitting at her desk on the other side of the glass where I can see her and if my need to be alone in that moment is particularly potent, I draw the curtains.
Her presence remains exactly as it was and I remain aware of it, but it doesn’t intrude on my attention in the same way.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>In his book </p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/world-beyond-your-head"><em>The World Beyond Your Head</em></a><p>, Matthew B. Crawford points out that this involuntary aspect of attention makes a lot of sense from an evolutionary standpoint.
New information demands attendance.
Is it a predator?
Prey?
Or just a gust of wind?
Regardless we must pay attention to it so we can make sense of it and integrate it into our mental model of the current environment.</p>
</div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Crawford appropriates the term <em>ecology</em> – the branch of biology that deals with the relations of organisms to one another and to their physical surroundings – to describe this fundamental relationship between our attention, our life, and our environment.
He describes, for example, the “ecology of attention” in airport lounges where the news stream endlessly on TVs oriented in various directions.
Even if the talking heads are muted, the infinite sideways scroll of symbols at the bottom of the screen will hijack the attention of travelers who would rather rest idly.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>(Crawford astutely points out that the advertisements shown on these TVs exist to continue the transfer of wealth from these common travelers to the ones in the VIP lounges, who rest comfortably without having their attention exploited by their surroundings without their consent.
I find these socioeconomic analyses of technology much more relevant and important than the technophobic ones.
The same goes for Artificial Intelligence.
I don’t worry that AI will take over the world, I worry that those who already rule the world will use AI to accelerate and automate processes of wealth extraction.)</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I think the evolutionary perspective can also help explain why time in nature feels so right.
This is the primordial ecology of our attention, the environment in which our brains adapted for us to live and thrive.
And yet I don’t think we need to draw purist or atavistic conclusions against technology from this observation.
Feelings of connection and coherence arise in us not only from time in nature, but also from time using artificial tools and inhabiting constructed environments.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>The humble coffee shop for example is a place where many of us go to read, write, think, converse, and do other things that require our focus.
The intricate weave of activity and mixture of sounds create a conducive ambience for our attention.
How is it that such a busy, public space is so popular for quiet, private activity?
This is only counterintuitive if we think distraction is the only unneutral effect our environment has on our ability to focus.
From experience we know that it can be easier to focus <em>in spite of</em>  extraneous sensory information rather than in absence of it.
Perhaps because our cognitive capacities evolved in settings where total absence of sensory input was rare, our minds focus more easily against a backdrop of mundane information.
Certain kinds of technologies are essential here and even computer screens are welcome, but not TVs because they would be too disruptive.
A good ecology of attention not only prevents distractions, but encourages focus.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I’ve moved into my apartment now, into the warmth.
Out in the balcony my fingers were getting too cold.
Above my head the clock ticks and farther away traffic brushes by in irregular strokes.
The faint wail of an ambulance emerges suddenly and then fades quickly.
Occasionally in the hallway outside our apartment a door opens and then shuts a moment later.
Our little dog scurries about the living room looking for amusement.
My wife Z works intently at her desk a few feet away in silence apart from intermittent bursts of typing and muted clicks of her mouse.
Attention to my writing flows easily despite all these things, except when my gaze drifts over to what is happening on her computer screen.
So I adjust my sitting position to make it vanish.</p></div>

  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">

    <div class="paragraph"><p>I almost quit this book as soon as I began it.
<!--more-->
It launches the reader into the mind of an unnamed character lying on his deathbed and babbling on about basic details that he himself did not know or understand.
He then proceeds to tell a mundane story in unfocused detail and with distracting metacommentary.
Italo Calvino’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_on_a_winter's_night_a_traveler"><em>If on a winter’s night a traveler</em></a> begins in a similar way.
Perhaps <em>Molloy</em> was an inspiration.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>The text was dense not only in style but also in line spacing.
A paragraph break on the second page and then no more in sight.
But I decided to push through.
I motivated myself by striving to read as many pages as possible in one sitting.
This worked well.
Once I’d waded in far enough, giving up was much less tempting.
It was satisfying to have made ample progress and, along the way, I’d begun enjoying the book.
The experience was like going for a run.
The first few minutes were uncomfortable and almost nauseating, but then I hit my stride and momentum carried me forth.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>I read most of the book in two or three weeks.
Then I let my attention drift towards other things.
(Movies including <em>The Godfather</em>, YouTube videos, the audiobook </p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/world-beyond-your-head"><em>The World Beyond Your Head</em></a><p>, and the book <a href="https://www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/book/9780801473036/the-neoliberal-city/"><em>The Neoliberal City</em></a>.)
Then I returned to it and read the last chunk over a few days.
Soon after I finished the book I watched several reviews about it on YouTube and even ended up rewriting the Plot Summary section of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molloy_(novel)">Wikipedia page</a> because I found it unclear and partly contaminated with the writer’s interpretation that the two protagonists must be the same person.
(I included my version of the plot summary at the end of this piece.)</p>
</div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I am not surprised to read on the Wikipedia page about Samuel Beckett that he is a contributor to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literary_nonsense">Nonsense Literature</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre_of_the_absurd">Theatre of the Absurd</a>.
<em>Molloy</em> is strangely interesting despite its bizarreness and the apparent pointlessness of its story.
One of its obvious qualities is the distinctiveness of each protagonist’s inner voice.
You feel like you are inside their head, and the inscrutability of certain passages heightens that experience.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>The novel is also very thoughtprovoking to consider in retrospect.
There are strong hints that Molloy and Moran are the same person, but it also isn’t clear that they are.
Moran never completes his mission of finding Molloy and instead begins to resemble him more and more.
For its structure and the enigma at the heart of it, <em>Molloy</em> reminds me of David Lynch’s movie <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mulholland_Drive_(film)"><em>Mulholland Drive</em></a>.
Lynch tells the story of an envious actress who arranges the assassination of her former lover and consequently plunges into deeper despair and intolerable guilt.
Lynch represents the irreparable shear that this trauma inflicts on the protagonist’s psyche by telling the story in two realities, a false sublimated one and then the real one.
Perhaps Beckett is doing something similar in <em>Molloy</em>.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>As interpreted by the psychoanalyst Dr. Olga Cox Cameron, the first part reproduces <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Interpretation_of_Dreams?oldformat=true">Freudian Dream Logic</a> by obsessively approaching objects of trauma with sublimated meanings and then fleeing further into fantasy when they become too intolerable to consider.</p></div>

<hr>

<h4 id="plot-summary">Plot Summary</h4>

<div class="paragraph"><p>The novel is about two characters and is divided into two parts. Each part is an internal monologue, the first of Molloy and the second of Jacques Moran.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Part One consists of two paragraphs: the first spans about two pages and the second more than eighty. The book opens with the narrator stating that he lives in his mother’s room, but does not remember how he arrived there or when his mother died. In this room he writes and every Sunday a man visits to pick up what he has written and bring back what he had taken last week “marked with signs” that Molloy never cares to read. Molloy writes to “speak of the things that are left, say [his] goodbyes, finish dying”. In the second paragraph, which comprises most of Part One, Molloy recounts a journey he took supposedly to find his mother. Throughout the journey, he struggles to remember that his aim is to meet his mother and finds himself endlessly sidetracked and delayed. Molloy suffers from severe physical disabilities, and so relies on his bicycle and his crutches for mobility. At one point, he gets momentarily arrested for resting on his bicycle in a lewd way. It is when speaking to the police in the station that we finally learn his name, which suddenly comes to him and he cries out while being questioned. Soon after his release, Molloy wanders through town and accidentally kills an old dog by running over it with his bicycle. A vicious mob starts forming, but then Molloy is rescued by the dog’s owner who forgives him and takes him into her home. He is fed, bathed, clothed, and allowed to live on the premises for free. Despite this, Molloy resents the woman – whose name he can’t quite remember: “a Mrs Loy… or Lousse, I forget, Christian name something like Sophie” – and after a long time finally musters the determination to leave, without his bicycle. Soon afterwards, he finds a place in an alley to harm himself, which brings him satisfaction. He remembers an old woman who used to compensate him for having intercourse with her and with whom he considers, absurdly, to have known true love. Molloy then journeys out of town towards the shore, having again forgotten his objective of finding his mother. He tells of living by the ocean for a while and describes in excruciating detail his process of circulating sixteens “sucking stones” across his four pockets to maximize the amount of time between which each stone is sucked. Eventually he leaves the shore and journeys through the woods. There, he encounters a man who appears to need help but Molloy ignores him. The man insists until Molloy becomes suddenly violent, beating the man until he stops moving. Soon afterwards, Molloy makes it out of the woods and Part One abruptly ends.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Part Two is narrated by a private detective by the name of Jacques Moran, who is assigned the task of tracking down Molloy and carrying out specific instructions. The task is given to him by a man named Gaber, who is apparently his supervisor and takes order from a higher boss named Youdi. This narrative (Part Two) begins:</p></div>

<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>It is midnight. The rain is beating on the windows.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>It becomes immediately apparent that Moran is a cruel and arbitrarily abusive father. He sets out on his journey to find Molloy and forces his son Jacques to come with him. They wander across the countryside, increasingly bogged down by the weather, decreasing supplies of food and Moran’s suddenly failing body. He sends his son to purchase a bicycle and while his son is gone, Moran encounters an old man with a large, but light walking stick. Later, Moran is confronted by another man, who he murders in a sudden violent outburst reminiscent of Molloy and hides his body in the forest. After a few days, the son returns with a bicycle and is aghast at his father’s appearance. Immediately, Moran resumes his senseless, violent treatment of his son and the two continue on their journey to Bally. In the outskirts of Bally, they encounter a shepherd with his dog and sheep. For some reason, Moran is transfixed and enchanted. In the morning, Moran wakes to find that his son has fled with the bicycle and most of the money. Moran takes the news with strange warmth and optimism. Moran finishes his provisions and gives up on his journey. He waits for starvation to kill him. Every night, he crawls out of his camp to look at the lights of Bally in the distance and “laughs” strenuously at the sight of it. One night, Moran finds Gaber outside his camp. They have an absurd exchange in which Moran pleads with Gaber to divulge what Youdi said. Gaber disappears quickly thereafter. Moran then embarks on what he understands to be his new assignment, returning home. He limps and drags himself through the countryside through the fall and winter at an excruciatingly slow pace and poses bizarre questions to himself about biblical topics and matters of the church. His ramblings begin to resemble Molloy’s from Part One. During his journey home, he is confronted by an angry farmer who demands to know what he is doing on his land. Feeling that preferred strategy of violence is too risky, Moran makes up a story about doing a pilgrimage and requests a tea to send the farmer away so that he can escape. When Moran finally arrives home, several months later, he laments the death of his bees and hens, which were left out all winter. He settles back into his home and begins to use crutches, like Molloy. Not for the first time, Moran mentions a “voice” that has been gradually speaking to him more and more, and which he claims to understand better now. The novel ends with Moran sitting down to write the report that his boss Youdi, his supervisor Gaber, and the mysterious voice keep demanding he write:</p></div>

  <div class="paragraph"><p>Then I went back into the house and wrote, It is midnight. The rain is beating on the windows. It was not midnight. It was not raining.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I also resumed reading and marveling at the prose in <em>Blood Meridian</em>.
I think it appropriate to take my time with what Harold Bloom called  “the major esthetic achievement of any living American writer.”
Of course, McCarthy has since died and his legacy has begun morphing due to recent news of a very inappropriate relationship he had with a teenage girl named Augusta Britt.</p></div>

<h3 id="watching-movies">watching movies</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Last year as soon as the weather started cooling and days darkening early I started watching movies.
In the last few months I’ve watched <em>The Substance</em>, <em>Woman of the Hour</em>, <em>We Live In Time</em>, <em>The Godfather</em> and <em>The Godfather Part 2</em>, <em>The Power of the Dog</em>, <em>Killers of the Flower Moon</em>, <em>Anora</em>, <em>A Real Pain</em>, <em>Perfect Days</em>, <em>Gladiator II</em>, and <em>Punch-Drunk Love</em>.
Reviews and ratings for these are or will be on <a href="https://letterboxd.com/okjuanito/films/reviews/">my letterboxd account</a>.
Tomorrow I’m going to watch <em>The Brutalist</em>.</p></div>

<h3 id="following-arsenal">following Arsenal</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Following the English Premier League is so interesting because the competition is so fierce and sophisticated.
It is so difficult for teams to win.
It is so difficult for fans or pundits to predict what will happen.
New players arrive, old ones fall away, young ones rise into prominence.
It’s a lucrative business but it is also genuine, gripping drama.</p></div>

<h3 id="whats-next">what’s next?</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>The year 2025 is a blank canvas.
We don’t have any specific plans.
Of course, it is predictable in some ways.
But perhaps more so, it is open ended.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I begin the year with several intentions.
Do big things at work.
Get fitter.
Lose twenty pounds.
Have more discussions with friends.
Read copiously.
Keep writing for and developing this site.
Nurture friendships.
Heal and grow.
Enjoy our DINK status.
Ruminate on longterm plans.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I round the corner of another year with the intention to change my life.
Change it not majorly, but minorly.
I intend to live in the same place, work the same job, drink the same coffee.
But I want to sharpen my focus.
I intend to withhold my attention a bit more and marshall it with more discipline towards things that matter.
That doesn’t mean I will scold myself if I waste time, or spend it on unimportant things.
But I want to try everyday to dedicate <em>more</em> attention to things that matter, to things that will accumulate rather than disappear into the void like jewelry into the drain.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I will continue resisting idealistic aspirations towards abstract virtue, but will try to submit myself to disciplines that I trust will render concrete results.
Spending more time reading.
Waking earlier.
Avoiding cheap distractions that undermine opportunities to spend time meaningfully.
I’m not so interested in deeming time spent scrolling on instagram or passively consuming recommended YouTube videos as immoral.
It is not bad to produce nothing or learn nothing for a few minutes on a random day, but it is costly to let it become a habit.
Costly in time and in opportunity.
I don’t believe I’m particularly special but I do think there is a version of me at eightysomething years old that looks back with some sastifaction at his life’s work.
I want to do something meaningful and I know the steady progress of minutes hours and days can lead to things that irregular bouts of inspiration can imagine but never produce.</p></div>
