  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">

    <div class="paragraph">
<p>I anticipate confusion regarding the name of this site.
How is it a book?
<!--more-->
Sure, it abides by the criteria of a socalled </p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/virtual-book">virtual book</a><p> – multimedia, readerdriven, nonlinear, etc – but it’s still basically just a blog, isn’t it?</p>
</div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Granted, this is not a book.
Not yet.
But over time, it may become one.
In fact I hope it will become multiple, overlapping books.
I intend to accumulate relevant and complementary content without prescribing a single vision or intention for it so that it can take a shape of its own.
<em>Shapes</em> of its own.
At points in the future I may be able to collect multiple pieces into discrete, booklike forms.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>It’s been two years since I began this project and already emerging are various potential booklike projects.
An obvious one is compiling posts from a title series like </p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/revise-a-sentence"><em>how to revise a sentence</em></a><p>, </p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/revise-a-sentence-2"><em>#2</em></a><p>, </p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/revise-a-sentence-3"><em>#3</em></a><p>, </p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/revise-a-sentence-4"><em>#4</em></a><p>, and so on, into a single work.
Naturally, other pieces tagged as <a href="/vbook/tags/writing">#writing</a> would make good candidates for inclusion in that work.
The same for </p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/tell-a-story"><em>how to tell a story</em></a><p>, </p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/tell-a-story-2"><em>#2</em></a><p>, </p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/tell-a-story-3"><em>#3</em></a><p>, and future entries.
These titles are intentionally broad so they can hold a variety of perspectives on the topic that may later be combined to serve unforeseen ends.
I expect that any such attempts will prompt me to write new material that fuses all the pieces together, thereby creating a seamless new whole.</p>
</div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>But that’s only one way in which I want “books” to develop from this site.
I also want them to sprout organically from the haphazard crosspollination of ideas that features like tagging and backlinking enable.
I recently implemented another feature called revisions – which I talked about in my Sept 30th 2024 </p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/now-sept-30-2024">/now</a><p> update – that adds yet another dimension through which a reader (including myself) can traverse the content on this site.
Automation is a powerful way to highlight implicit relationships that already exist between pieces.
They enable unplanned connections to grow across topics and time.
The next feature I intend to automate is a simple and intuitive one: links between posts in a title series.</p>
</div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>It’s fitting that this site itself is the fusion product of </p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/come-up-with-ideas">various heterogenous inspirations</a><p>.
As I’ve said before, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten">Zettelkasten method</a> of knowledge management is one of them.
The method, as noted by researcher Andy Matuschak on his own <a href="https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zDcuS8A5uxGR8hQygsqP83A">Zettelkasten-inspired website</a>, enabled Germany sociologist Niklas Luhmann to publish more than 70 books.
My writing ambitions are far more modest, but I am interested in adapting the method into a way of writing “books” <em>directly</em>, as opposed to its original purpose of amassing research into a network of information that may then be synthesized and captured in newly written prose.
I want to <em>start</em> by writing prose in small chunks and see if the resulting pieces can themselves comprise a booklike thing.</p>
</div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>And yet the point of this site is not to become a book, but to provide booklike experiences </p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/virtual-book">without subjecting itself to the traditional limits</a><p> of a book.
The point is not merely to create books through piecemeal writing, but also to offer pieces by themselves and as an assortment of nonlinear orderings, unlike the offering of the traditional book: single, linear, and monolithic.
This site is not just a means but an end itself.</p>
</div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Finally, I want to say that, despite all this, I don’t look at books with contempt or ungratefulness.
I love books.
They have changed my life for the better and I’d like to return the favor.</p></div>
</div>
<a class="u-url" href="/vbook/what-3" hidden></a>
</article>

      </div>
    </div></div><p> made me think about how this site reimagines the <em>process</em> of writing books to emulate the process of software development.
<!--more-->
This subtle point is most concisely represented by the fact that I’m developing this site <em>as a prototype</em> of a virtual book.
Software prototypes serve, among other purposes, to explore the viability and value of an idea by developing a minimal version of it.
This site is one such experiment.
The development of the idea of a virtual book through its implementation.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>The more I reflect on it, the more I notice how my development of this “virtual book” is informed by principles of software development.
I am writing it as selfcontained <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_programming">modules</a> of prose that can be referenced and even imported into one another via the hoverbox feature I implemented </p><a class='hover-link'  href="/vbook/now-apr-23-2024">earlier this year</a><div class='hover-card-container'><div class='hover-card'>

<h3 id="life">Life</h3>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>My weight loss progress has stalled.
I’m 15lbs lighter than I was in June of last year but the red needle on my bathroom scale has been trembling at the same position for weeks.
I’m playing soccer twice a week now, but going on fewer walks.
I am mindful about what I eat, but I don’t track it.
I said in my </p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/now-feb-19-2024">last update</a><p> that I would try not finishing my serving just because it’s served, but even with the goal in mind I find it very difficult to do.
Years ago I saw an ad for a habit-focused weight loss app called Noom that said that finishing your plate is often an impulse ingrained in childhood.
I think that’s true for me.
In any case, I suspect my biggest hurdle to further weight loss is snacking before bedtime.
I’d still like to lose another 25lbs, but I think I’m going to put it on the backburner for now.
Cruise until I catch a second wind.</p>
</div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Like I mentioned, I’m playing soccer twice a week.
7v7 games, mostly.
My cardio is not amazing, but definitely much better than it was at the start of the year.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I’ve gone snowboarding twice.
Finally!
Once at Cypress Mountain on a weekday evening and once at Mt Seymour on a weekend afternoon.
Both are within a thirty minute drive from Vancouver, which is incredible.
From Cypress there are stunning views of the city, the inlet, and the nearby islands.
The season is coming to an end but I’m hoping to go to Grouse Mountain soon, which is less than twenty minutes away from Vancouver.
Access to ski resorts in Vancouver is astounding.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Z and I have been </p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/walk">exploring the neighborhoods</a><p> around us and loving it.
Occasionally I go for a long nighttime walk on my own, as I have done for years, and a recent one resulted in Z and I getting tickets to see </p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/vieux-farka-toure">Vieux Farka Touré</a><p>.
It turned out to be one of the live music performances I’ve most enjoyed attending.</p>
</div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Z and I did a five week improv course in Vancouver.
We met some nice people and had a novel and interesting experience.
We think we might take standup comedy classes next.
Z is initiating these activities, but I’m happy to follow along.</p></div>

<h3 id="travel">Travel</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Z and I are going to Tofino for my mom’s birthday in May and then to NYC a week later.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>We recently stayed at an Airbnb on Lake Cavanaugh with friends.
We jumped in the water and it was freezing.
I’m very happy I did it though.</p></div>

<h3 id="work">Work</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>A couple weeks ago I silently celebrated my two year anniversary working on <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-loop">Microsoft Loop</a>.
It’s the longest I’ve worked on a single product or team and by far the one I’ve enjoyed the most.
The problems are interesting, the work is in line with my career interests, the product is exciting, the people are great, the work life balance is stellar.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Although I had a dip in motivation several weeks ago, I’ve been quite motivated recently.
Managing one’s motivation is a nonobvious and little discussed but essential skill.
Over the years I’ve recognized it as such and tried to improve at it.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Tomorrow I’m giving a talk about rewriting history in Git.
I’m looking forward to it!</p></div>

<h3 id="coding">Coding</h3>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>I implemented hoverboxes on this site!
If you’re on a computer, hover over </p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/now-feb-19-2024">this link</a><p> and you’ll see a preview of my previous ‘now’ update.
It was nontrivial but educational to implement.
I’ve always liked the idea of doing DIY.
Does this count?</p>
</div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I haven’t worked on my app <a href="https://okjuan.me/muze-radio"><strong>Muze Radio</strong></a> for a couple months.
Spotify denied my request for an <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/concepts/rate-limits">extended quota</a>, which would allow anyone with Spotify Premium to use it.
I addressed their silly reason and resubmitted the request.
That was well over six weeks ago, which is their expected turnaround time.
On the Spotify Dashboard, I see a message banner stating that <em>The review is taking longer than expected</em>.
Yeah, I know.
I suppose I can’t be too annoyed though.
It’s free.
Once they accept my request, I’ll probably have motivation to resume work on it.</p></div>

<h3 id="reading">Reading</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Listened to a good deal of Mary Norris’s <em>Between Me and You: Confessions of a Comma Queen</em>.
I enjoyed the first bit, including the part about Ben Webster and the dictionary, which I found really interesting.
But my interest in the book began falling sharply with Norris’s rants about the gender of pronouns and such.
I just didn’t care.
According to her, ‘they’ doesn’t work as a gender neutral pronoun because it’s plural.
Silliness.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Room to Dream</em>, David Lynch’s autiobiography-memoir.
A great read, especially as companion material to </p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/elephant-man">his</a><p> </p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/wild-at-heart">movies</a><p>.
I found it inspirational.
Not only is David Lynch an important artist, but also a good person.</p>
</div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p></p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/the-passenger"><em>The Passenger</em></a><p>, which I read out of interest after reading </p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/stella-maris">Stella Maris</a><p> and because I love </p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/write-like-cormac">how Cormac writes</a><p>.</p>
</div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Some New Yorker articles, including one <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2024/02/12/the-furies-by-elizabeth-flock-review-if-love-could-kill-by-anna-motz">on Female Violence</a>.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I sampled Temple Grandin’s book about <em>Visual Thinking</em>, but I didn’t have appetite for it.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>I continue reading <em>The Death and Life of Great American Cities</em>, without haste.
I am trying to digest and </p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/walk">apply</a><p> its ideas.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="writing">Writing</h3>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>I’ve been writing with some regularity.
Mostly, but not exclusively, <a href="https://okjuan.me/vbook/tags/reviews/">reviews</a> and <a href="https://okjuan.me/vbook/tags/journal/">journal entries</a>.
I wrote </p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/career-2">part #2</a><p> of </p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/career">my career</a><p>, a project I’m excited to continue.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="tv">TV</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I keep watching Arsenal games and they keep winning.
Arteta is undeniably effective.
His decisions are questionable sometimes, but so far he has managed to produce answers for them.
Arsenal still has a chance at winning the English Premier League, but it isn’t entirely up to them.
Everyone is thrilled to have three title contenders with only a handful of games left and nobody can predict who will win it.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I’ve also been working on the decor of our apartment.
I put up small floating shelves in our bedroom, which was intimidating because I had never before drilled holes for wall anchors.
Bought a rubber plant and a wall mirror for the plant corner in our living room.
Continually propagating my pothos snippings and planting them in nursery pots.
In addition to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@nevertoosmall">Never Too Small</a>, which I’ve been watching for years now, I’ve started watching videos by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@noahdaniel.studio">Noah Daniel</a>, a small new YouTuber who is an interior designer with a passion for <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Modern_architecture">modern architecture</a> and design.
It’s been interesting.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p><em>True Detective</em> season 4, which had my attention at first, but then lost it.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p><em>The Curse</em>.
Have only watched a couple episodes but I think it’s so good.
Can’t wait to keep watching.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p><em>Veep</em>.
So funny.
Reminds me a lot of <em>Arrested Development</em> and <em>Peep Show</em>, other shows about pathetic characters written with scathing comedy wit.
<em>The Other Two</em> is similar.
I’ve been catching episodes of it here and there while Z watches it.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p><em>The Office</em> continues to be a go-to comfort show for me.
I have that strange but apparently common capacity to rewatch it endlessly.
I do the same with the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/34mXWuUCEa2UzTft5vxxLp?si=30f306edb2b04a6f">Ricky Gervais Show</a>, even though I think Ricky is a prat and his standup comedy unimaginative crap.</p></div>

<h3 id="movies">Movies</h3>

<div class="paragraph">
<p></p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/dune-2">Wild at Heart</a><p>, which was a worthy Lynch work.</p>
</div>

<div class="paragraph"><p><em>The Zone of Interest</em>, which was stellar.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p></p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/dune-2">Dune Part 2</a><p> which was pretty much as good as a megablockbuster gets.</p>

<h3 id="whats-next">What’s next?</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I have some interesting tasks at work right now.
Looking forward to seeing how those progress.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I’m looking forward to visiting Tofino and NYC.
Also looking forward to doing more outdoor activities with friends, like paddleboarding and playing volleyball.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>I have tickets to see Nate Smith, Carrtoons, and Kiefer in Seattle in May.
Excited for it.
I’ll update </p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/concerts">my concert log</a><p> afterward, like I did for </p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/hailu-mergia">Hailu Mergia</a><p>.</p>
</div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Excited but nervous about the last several EPL games.
It’s going to be a huge disappointment if Arsenal don’t win the title after such a fantastic season.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Z and I are developing new friendships in Vancouver.
Looking forward to forming a dynamic with a group of people like we have in Seattle.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>As I write, I don’t have substantial reading or writing goals.
At this point, I have developed both habits, so I expect them to carry me on for the next several weeks, at least.</p></div>

(To see what I mean, hover over that last link with your mouse, if you’re on desktop.)
I am <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration">continuously developing and publishing</a> this site so that it is “complete” after every iterative addition I make to it despite my intention to make many more changes in the future.
It is never incomplete nor is it ever finished.

    <div class="paragraph"><p>I’ve been developing <strong>Muze Radio</strong>, reading Stephen King, watching <em>Poor Things</em>, and more.</p></div>

<h3 id="life">Life</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Finally filed Z’s green card papers.
Phew!
Now we wait.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Whereas I was enjoying the fall, I’m not really enjoying the winter.
Winters are so gray here, in the Pacific Northwest.
It’s making Z and I fantasize about living in a place with sunnier winters.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Visiting my mom and sisters in Victoria.
Spending lots of time in my favorite coffee shops – <a href="https://heyhappycoffee.com/">Hey Happy</a>, <a href="https://www.saint-cecilia.ca/">St. Cecilia</a>, <a href="https://discoverycoffee.com/">Discovery Coffee</a>.
We’re not staying for long, so I probably won’t see many of my friends.
Our cousin is with us, visiting from Spain.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Z and I have been socializing with friends and family a lot in the last couple weeks.
Luckily, we both have a need for periodic “alone time”, a term I learned from her.
We support each other in our routine quest for it.
I’ve been realizing that I’m quite introverted.
I think it’s taken me a long time to realize because of how social Mexican culture is.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I think I lost another 4ish pounds, but I’m a bit skeptical of my vintage bathroom scale that I bought at Goodwill a few years ago.
Can my weight really fluctuate 8lbs in 24hrs??
Z googled it and apparently it’s possible.
I confirmed by weighing myself on my mom’s bathroom scale (also vintage) while visiting Victoria.
Apparently it’s true!
I’ve lost ~17lbs since mid-June.
At this rate of 2.8lbs per month, I’ll hit my goal weight by October 2024.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I’ve had fewer chances to play soccer recently.
Looking forward to playing in January.
I went to the physio and got some exercises to address a recurring issue I have with my right hip/groin.
I’m not diligent with the exercises though, never have been.
I find it hard to keep to scheduled or pre-determined activities.</p></div>

<h3 id="coding">Coding</h3>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>I didn’t end up working on this site.
I’m bad at adhering to plans, even my own.
Instead I tend to follow </p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/progress-without-planning">my impulses</a><p>.</p>
</div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Instead of working on this site, I started a new project: a web app I called <strong>Muze Radio</strong>.
It’s a new and improved version of <a href="https://github.com/okjuan/muze">Muze Player</a>, a web app I made in my last year of university (2018-2019).
The code is <a href="https://github.com/okjuan/muze-radio">here</a> and the beta version of the app is available <a href="https://okjuan.me/muze-radio">here</a>.
I started on the new version on a whim and ended up obsessed for several days.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>As my obsession gives way to a healthier interest, I am very happy to have published a functional version of the app.
Ever since I read <a href="https://awilkinson.medium.com/skateboard-bike-car-6bec841ed96e">this article</a> in 2016, whenever I work on a project, I dutifully remind myself: if you want to build a car, build a skateboard first.
Then a bike.
Then a car.
At the end of each stage of the development process, you should have something that is not only an improvement on the previous version but also useful by itself.
This prevents wasted effort and enables incremental improvement.
If I suddenly stop working on this app and return to it in a year or two, I will find a minimal, functional app.
I could pick up where I left off without having to first fix a bunch of half-implemented features.
If instead I returned to an ambitious but incomplete prototype, I’d be (rightfully) tempted to scrap it and start over instead of trying to salvage it.</p></div>

<h3 id="reading">Reading</h3>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>I ended up reading all of Stephen King’s </p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/on-writing">On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft</a><p>.
Really enjoyed it.
Many of the recent posts on this site reference it.
In his book, King was entertaining and insightful, but he struck me as somewhat narrow-minded in an interview he did with Charlie Rose.
I understand that King was one of many blind to the brilliance of Kubrick’s adaptation of <em>The Shining</em>, but I was put off by King’s unwavering confidence in dismissing the film as a failure.</p>
</div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I got curious about Stephen King’s fiction and started <em>The Green Mile</em>, which is supposed to be one of his best, but I lost interest.
The audiobook’s cheesy narrator didn’t help.
My impression is that King is a capable pop fiction writer, but not a literary standout.
Maybe I’ll give <em>The Stand</em> or <em>The Shining</em> a try later on.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>I’ve been loving audiobooks on Spotify.
I can’t believe my luck.
I started listening to Bruce Springsteen’s memoir, but then thought of Mark Lanegan’s memoir, </p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/sing-backwards-and-weep">Sing Backwards and Weep</a><p>, which is supposed to be great.
I put that on instead and it gripped me instantly.
It reminds me of </p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/fear-and-loathing">Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas</a><p>, but is much bleaker and written in a conversational voice.
More on this book forthcoming.</p>
</div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>A hundred pages into </p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/infinite-jest">Infinite Jest</a><p>.
We’ll see how far I get.
Read up a bit on the cultural lore around this book.
The New Yorker article <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/11/05/how-to-read-infinite-jest">How to Read “Infinite Jest”</a> was one of the highlights.</p>
</div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Continuing with Jane Jacobs’s <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30833.The_Death_and_Life_of_Great_American_Cities">The Death and Life of Great American Cities</a>.
Over two hundred pages in, still great.
She’s not afraid to follow up her criticisms of orthodox city planning with concrete criteria for good city planning.
She values concreteness and reality above almost all other things.
She routinely and smartly derides “abstractions”.
What matters are real people, real places, real events.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Started <em>Bird By Bird</em> by Anne Lamott.
Did not grab me.
I suspect I’d have to push or skip through a bunch of content that I’m already familiar with to get to the new and thought-provoking stuff.
This is to be expected, considering I’ve read a lot of </p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/several-short-sentences">books</a><p> </p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/wounds-of-passion">about</a><p> </p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/draft-4">writing</a><p> </p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/on-writing">recently</a><p>.
I might listen to <em>Bird By Bird</em> some more, but I have a few other audiobooks waiting in my Spotify library:</p>
</div>
<ul>
  <li>Rick Rubin’s <em>The Creative Act: A Way of Being</em>
</li>
  <li>Temple Grandin’s <em>Visual Thinking: The Hidden Gifts of People Who Think in Pictures, Patterns, and Abstractions</em>
</li>
  <li>Rose Hackman’s <em>Emotional Labor: The Invisible Work Shaping Our Lives and How to Claim Our Power</em>
</li>
  <li>Peter Attia’s <em>Outlive: The Science and Art of Longevity</em>
</li>
  <li>Bruce Springsteen’s <em>Born to Run</em>
</li>
  <li>Maria Bamford’s <em>Sure, I’ll Join Your Cult: A Memoir of Mental Illness and the Quest to Belong Anywhere</em>
</li>
</ul>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I saw Rick Rubin’s book displayed in a store window for $40 or something like that.
It was a pretty book, but $40, really?
I checked Spotify and sure enough the audiobook is included in Spotify premium.
We should resist the invitation to view books as commodities.
When you feel the impulse to buy a book, ask yourself:
How excited would you be if the cover was ugly or stained or if the book was used but in fair condition?
That is, do you want it for its substance or its aesthetic?</p></div>

<h3 id="writing">Writing</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I am happy to see, looking back at the past month, that I’ve written several small pieces:</p></div>

<ul>
  <li>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/chart-moods">how to chart moods</a><p></p>

</li>
</ul>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>As I mentioned above, many of these reference Stephen King’s book </p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/on-writing">On Writing</a><p>.
I love letting my activities overlap like this.
Let what I am reading feed into what I’m writing, what music I’m listening to, what movies and shows I’m watching, and vice versa.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="tv">TV</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p><em>How To with John Wilson</em>, season three.
Didn’t realize this was the last season until I casually finished watching the last episode.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p><em>The Last of Us</em>, season one.
I loved the ending of the season, although it also broke my heart.
Brave, truthful writing.
(Regarding Joel, at least.
It’s ludicrous that the other characters gave him the opportunity to do what he did, though.)</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p><em>Severance</em> and <em>Westworld</em>, both season one.
Both have really interesting premises, but neither grabs my attention.
The writing in <em>Westworld</em> feels a bit off-the-mark.
And <em>Severance</em> is a bit slow-paced.</p></div>

<h3 id="movies">Movies</h3>

<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Poor Things</em>, Yorgos Lanthimos’s new movie.
One of my favorite movies of recent times.
More thoughts </p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/poor-things">here</a><p>.</p>
</div>

<div class="paragraph"><p><em>Promising Young Woman</em>.
Second watch, this time with Z.
She’s right that the movie is disappointing in its treatment of such a serious and important subject.
It pulls every punch.
Instead of rage and vengeance, we see wrist-slapping and finger-wagging.
<em>Poor Things</em> promises much less and delivers much more feminist catharsis.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p><em>Catch Me If You Can</em>.
Turned it off.
I’m realizing Spielberg is not my favorite.
Maybe he’s like the Stephen King of movies.
Several weeks ago I started watching <em>The Fablemans</em> on the plane and it felt a bit ridiculous, had to turn that off, too.</p></div>

  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">

    <div class="paragraph"><p>I wrote an essay called <a href="https://okjuan.medium.com/the-virtual-book-part-1-782ccd4cc360">The Virtual Book</a> but I never defined the term.
<!--more-->
By virtual book I mean a book unbound by the traditional and physical constraints of printed books.
I say ‘virtual’ because the greatest possibilities I see are in the virtual world of computers.
Ebooks and audiobooks are just the beginning.
The possibilities that excite me challenge not only the physicality of books but also their more subtle attributes.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>A virtual book can be <strong>multimedia</strong>.
It can consist of words, images, video, audio.
There, we got the obvious one out of the way.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>A virtual book can be <strong>readerdriven</strong>.
Instead of forcing readers to follow the author’s thought process, a virtual book can let each reader steer the way.
Wikipedia does this already.
It lets you search the page for keywords, skip to the section you’re interested in, and even escape into a tangential topic, never to return.
This is a natural way to consume Wikipedia because its form <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Affordance">affords</a> it.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Books generally have one start and one ending, but a virtual book can be <strong>nonlinear</strong>.
Wikipedia is again the obvious example.
But letting the reader drive is only one way to create a nonlinear book.
It’s also possible to create multiple entrypoints, or even multiple endings, like <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Black_Mirror:_Bandersnatch">Black Mirror: Bandersnatch</a>.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>A virtual book can be <strong>dynamic</strong>.
It can change after its initial creation.
Printed books, on the other hand, are static snapshots laboriously rendered by a particular author at a particular time.
But what if a theory is debunked?
Or a hypothesis confirmed?
Or a record shattered?
Or, in the case of storytelling, what if a loose end can be tied up neatly?</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>A virtual book can be <strong>nonmonolithic</strong>.
It does not need to be discrete or selfcontained.
It can consist of many interconnected parts that make up the whole but can exist without it.
It can reference other virtual books, borrow bits from them, and lend bits of its own.
For example, if Herbie Hancock’s memoir was a virtual audiobook, it could allow its snippets to be reconstrued into a documentary about jazz.
(If Ken Burns’ Jazz documentary series was also ‘virtualized’, it could have been updated 15 years after its release to include bits of Herbie’s narration.)
In fact, it could provide material for documentaries about many different topics: jazz, funk, hip hop, Miles Davis, Black Nationalism, Nichiren Buddhism, meditation, and crack addictions, to name some of the obvious ones.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>A virtual book can be <strong>responsive</strong>.
What if a reader could expect a book to field spontaneous questions?
ChatGPT is an obvious candidate here, but the possibility is broader.
What if Herbie Hancock returned to his memoir every now and then to answer questions that readers had left behind while reading it?
What if readers could raise flags on issues that factcheckers would then verify or return to the author for amendment?</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>The possibilities are plenty, and they are thrilling.
The difficulty in realizating them is not technological, but legal and political.
Powerful companies – and therefore governments – are hugely incentivized to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Swartz">prevent the free exchange of “intellectual property”</a>.
To make virtual books possible, we need not only the technological power of software, but also its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons">progressive politics</a>.</p></div>
