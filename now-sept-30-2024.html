<h3 id="getting-injured">getting injured</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I’ve been getting a bit unlucky.
My first attempt at returning to soccer goalkeeping resulted in a badly sprained finger.
The xray showed “a couple tiny fragments of bone,” which the hand doctor that I was later referred to described as “technically a break.”
To him I relayed the playful question my friend had asked: what happens to the bits of bone?
Yes, he confirmed, they get “resorbed.”
(A subsequent internet search confirmed it was indeed a real word.)</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>A few weeks later, back in the outfield, my domain, I took a meanly struck soccer ball to the back of the head.
In my couple decades of playing soccer, I’ve headed many, many balls deliberately and even taken several to the face.
But I can’t recall ever getting hit so firmly on the back of the head, or it ever hurting so much.
The real headache, though, was navigating the quagmire of bureacratic medical advice.
Was I really in mortal danger?
Or could I just go home and rest?
After a lot deliberating, consulting, and a tentative visit to the Emergency Room, my wife and I decide to go home for the night and consult a doctor the next day.</p></div>

<h3 id="visiting-the-canadian-east">visiting the Canadian East</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Z and I spent a week in the Toronto area and then a week in Prince Edward Island.
It’s embarrassing how much friendlier folks are over there compared to Vancouverites.
One of our theories on the subject is that it is easier to make friends in cities with more transplants, since they are circumstantially motivated to make connections.
People who have lived in a place for a long time already have an established social network and are therefore not incentivized to form new friendships.
Especially when the local culture is one of polite detachment.
In Vancouver, strangers walking past each other on the sidewalk rarely look at each other, even in residential neighborhoods.
It’s very offputting for me and Z.
We are warm and friendly people.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Before I moved to Seattle in 2019, I was warned of the <em>Seattle freeze</em>, the aloof attitude of locals and their aversion towards making new friends.
But this stereotype never matched my experience of Seattle.
Everyday I have friendly interactions with folks – at the coffee shop, by the mailboxes, at the lake, on the street.
The generous spirit extends to include dogs, which can be found everywhere in the city – in grocery stores, in shops, in pubs, and even in restaurants.
I suspect that the tech boom and consequent influx of transplants from all over the US, Canada, and abroad has made the city a good place to make friends.
Notably, my friends here are almost exclusively <em>not</em> from Seattle.
Several from Winnipeg and Victoria, one from Brooklyn, one from Arkansas, one from Connecticut, one from Montreal, one from Oregon, a few from the Midwest, and so on.</p></div>

<h3 id="forming-a-commune">forming a commune</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>One of my best friends just bought a house in West Seattle and a bunch of us are seriously considering moving in with him.
I would live upstairs with him and three of our friends would live in the groundlevel suite downstairs.
It’s an exciting prospect, even though it would mean giving up our lovely apartment in Capitol Hill.
I would really miss the proximity to urban life, but would love to live in a little complex with a bunch of people I really like.
According to an architecture book I’m currently reading, <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/A_Pattern_Language"><em>A Pattern Language</em></a>, that’s how people should live.
It asserts that even couples should not live alone:</p></div>

<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>ideally, every couple is a part of a larger group household…If this can not be so, try to build the house for the couple in such a way as to tie it together with some other households, to form the beginnings of a group household, or, if this fails, at least to form the beginnings of a House Cluster.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>The catalyst for this potential move is that Z and I want to reduce the total we spend on rent across our two homes, mine in Seattle and hers in Vancouver.
But the change has the potential to be much more than a practical compromise.
With our friends living downstairs, we would realize the House Cluster.
The backyard, which includes a garden, would serve as a sort of “public land” connecting our households.
The book makes strong claims about these aspects:</p></div>

<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>People will not feel comfortable in their houses unless a group of houses forms a cluster, with the public land between them jointly owned by all the householders.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Even if I don’t end up moving, I am very excited to help my friend plan, furnish, and decorate his new space.
And the book is serving as perfect inspiration.</p></div>

<h3 id="reading--writing">reading &amp; writing</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>There’s something strangely satisfying about starting a new book while traveling.
While in Toronto and PEI, I returned to <em>A Pattern Language: Towns, Buildings, Construction</em>, a book I’d perused a few years ago.
I was reminded of the book while writing my personal list of essential homemaking ingredients and came up with the title </p><a class='hover-link'  href="/vbook/my-pattern-language">my pattern language</a><div class='hover-card-container'><div class='hover-card'>

  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">

    <blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>most…wonderful places of the world were not made by architects, but by the people.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<!--more-->
<div class="paragraph"><p>That’s a quote from <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/79766.A_Pattern_Language"><em>A Pattern Language: Towns, Buildings, Construction</em></a>, a book published in 1977 that I came across a few years ago while thumbing through the Seattle Public Library’s virtual collection on Libby.
Something about the unusual title and the minimal, uncommercial cover called to me.
I checked it out, perused it, then put it aside.
I spent scant time with it, but its basic idea stuck with me.</p></div>

<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>The elements of this language are entities called patterns. Each pattern describes a problem which occurs over and over again in our environment, and then describes the core of the solution to that problem, in such a way that you can use this solution a million times over, without ever doing it the same way twice.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>The book lists two hundred and fiftythree of these, spanning in scope from regions to rooms and graded with the degree of confidence that the authors have in the solution’s immutability.
Despite being defined loosely to allow flexible application, the patterns are also defined concretely, often specified numerically and illustrated with pictures and diagrams.
The patterns are ordered by scale from big to small, but they also contain references that connect them into subnetworks.
Forward references elucidate how larger patterns depend on smaller ones and backreferences contextualize patterns in larger ones.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>I find the approach – flexible, deferential, and associative – rather appealing.
In fact, the book abides by various principles of my </p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/virtual-book">virtual book</a><p> idea, namely: multimedia, readerdriven, nonlinear, and nonmonolithic.
As a big fan of wikis, I’m pleased to read that it inspired the <a href="https://omni.wikiwand.com/en/articles/WikiWikiWeb">first online wiki</a>.
And as a programmer, I’m intrigued to learn that it inspired the idea of <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Software_design_pattern">software design patterns</a>, which are a core part of the industry vernacular.</p>
</div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>The book is, finally, an inspiration for me to create my own pattern language.
I love interior design, placemaking, vibesetting, and lately I’ve been thinking about what elements make a homespace great.
I’ve loved furnishing, laying out, and decorating my apartments, and I look forward to owning a house someday.</p></div>

<h3 id="i-good-bed">i) good bed</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>A full for myself, queen or king if I’m sharing with my wife.
Two pillows for myself.
Fitted sheet and a duvet, no top sheet.
The duvet cover made of a high quality, breathable material in a nice color.
It must have eight ties inside it to keep the duvet in place and a zipper at the bottom hidden behind a flap.
While using the bed, I don’t want to notice a separation between the duvet and its cover.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>The frame must be sturdy and stable.
No squeaking when getting in and out of bed.</p></div>

<h3 id="ii-walk-in-shower">ii) walk-in shower</h3>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>I never take baths.
Even when I do, they’re not so much a luxury as a trifle.
Showering, on the other hand, is special.
It is, first of all, a daily respite, a place to relax and recharge.
But what makes it invaluable is that it doubles as an opportunity to </p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/think-invisibly">listen to my subsconscious</a><p>.
And for this moment to flourish fully and consistently, I need the right physical space.</p>
</div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Good design, as they say, is invisible.
A good shower demands no effort or conscious attention from its user.
It lets them get clean while their mind wanders.
To achieve this, it must make it extremely easy to do all the basic things: get in, stand, wash, rinse, and get out.
It sounds obvious, but the standard tubshower hybrid most of us have at home </p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/good-shower">fails this basic test</a><p>.</p>
</div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Bonus points for nice tiles and for a flat entry with no intermediary ledge.</p></div>

<h3 id="iii-diffused--ambient-lighting">iii) diffused &amp; ambient lighting</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I hate overhead lighting that is bright and direct.
The inconvenience of switching off five lamps in a living room is nothing compared to having to withstand the piercing glare of bare bulbs shining down horribly into my eyes.
For switch-operated room lights, I much prefer track lighting aimed at the wall or lights diffused by rice paper pendants.
The goal is to create a <a href="https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxqTsun7JQzd0off7M8o5DlJ983OV63snW?si=xKxDqYwS4oq-6glt">soup of light</a>.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Also, as per pattern #252, <em>pools of light</em>, lights should accentuate or even delineate spaces and subspaces.
Don’t just light a whole room, light each space within the room.
And, importantly, “spaces” should be defined by human activity and experience: a private corner where you or your loved ones sit to read, an area where a little group may sit to talk or play games, etc.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Recently, while visiting Halifax, Nova Scotia, my wife Z and I sat in the corner of a coffee shop, admiring its beautiful interior.
Throughout our trip, I had been pointing out places where patterns were applied or might have been.
Suddenly I realized we were sitting in one.
#179 <em>alcoves</em> calls for a subspace within a larger space to which a subgroup of the larger group can retreat to socialize in partial privacy without vacating the bigger communal space, thereby conserving the feeling of connection that comes with sharing space with others.
(While writing this I notice that coffee shops are a place where it is crucial to create alcoves, and not just once, but many times over.)</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>The pattern calls for a lowered ceiling, which suggests that the pattern be planned during construction.
(In fact, this imperative is codified as a general pattern: #207 <em>structure follows social spaces</em>.)
But the coffee shop used a clever alternative to achieve a similar effect: they placed a light fixture directly above our corner seating and brought it down to a low height so that it functioned like a lowered ceiling.
This technique merges #179 <em>alcoves</em> and #252 <em>pools of light</em> in the way that the book likens to poetry:</p></div>

<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>In a poem, the meaning is far more dense [than in prose]. Each word carries several meanings; and the sentence as a whole carries an enormous density of interlocking meanings, which together illuminate the whole.</p></div>

  <div class="paragraph"><p>The same is true for pattern languages. It is possible to make buildings by stringing together patterns, in a rather loose way. A building made like this, is an assembly of patterns. It is not dense. It is not profound. But it is also possible to put patterns together in such a way that many many patterns overlap in the same physical space: the building is very dense; it has many meanings captured in a small space; and through this density, it becomes profound.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="iv-plants">iv) plants</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Especially leafy ones.
Pothos, monstera, ficus.
I’m not a huge fan of aloe veras or succulents.
Snake plants are ok.</p></div>

<h3 id="v-comfy-couch">v) comfy couch</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Whenever I see a home tour on YouTube and it lacks a cushy sofa in the living room, I mourn it.
Armchairs and chairs are not enough.
For me, couches are fundamental.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I am picky how the couch feels to sit on, too.
I think I prefer a slightly low and certainly a deep seat.
Its texture and color matter, too.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Also, see pattern #251, <em>different chairs</em>, which provides seating variety to create options for different people or the same people in different moods.</p></div>

<h3 id="vi-dishwasher">vi) dishwasher</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I don’t like to wash dishes by hand.
It takes so long.
And it feels meaningless, unlike other chores, like plant watering.
Plus, I’m prone to excema.</p></div>

<h3 id="vii-ample-natural-light">vii) ample natural light</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I need big and many windows.
In the living room, at least, artificial lighting should be optional in the daytime.
Northfacing windowsills (in the northern hemisphere) are fantastic for plants.
Direct sunlight is nice, even if just a little bit.</p></div>

<h3 id="viii-coffee-setup">viii) coffee setup</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Preferrably an espresso machine with a grinder with a portafilter holder.
At least, a pourover setup: a gooseneck kettle, a cone dripper, a scale, and a burr grinder.</p></div>

<h3 id="ix-tv-with-a-good-sound-system">ix) TV with a good sound system</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Makes me sad to watch movies on TV speakers.</p></div>

<h3 id="x-artwork">x) artwork</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>On the walls.
Nothing fancy.
Nicelooking stuff and stuff with personal significance (see pattern #253, <em>things from your life</em>).
Not generic or massproduced prints.
Trendy interior design brands have ruined Matisse figure prints, at least for a few years.</p></div>

<h3 id="xi-worktable-with-a-monitor">xi) worktable with a monitor</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I say worktable instead of desk because my current worktable is actually our dinner table.
It’s a great setup because we don’t use it much otherwise.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Preferrably with a big table surface.
Bonus points for a mounted monitor that doesn’t take up any deskspace and can be swiveled out of the way.</p></div>

<h3 id="xii-nice-dishware">xii) nice dishware</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I like an assortment of glasses and mugs.
Nice shapes, materials, and weight.
Uniform cutlery.
Matching set of dishes, bowls, and bowl plates.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I don’t care for the massproduced mugs, regardless of what image or words are imprinted on them.
I like large handles so that it is easy to hold the mug with one hand without touching or bumping into the hot mug’s sidesurface.</p></div>

<h3 id="xiii-easy--fast-access-to-street">xiii) easy &amp; fast access to street</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>It’s annoying to fish for my keys or a fob to unlock doors.
For that reason, I sometimes prefer parking on the street than in a garage.
In general, I love being able to walk out of my home and virtually straight onto the street.
I like views but they’re not worth long elevator waits.
A view of a nice neighborhood street or leafy trees is enough for me.</p></div>

<h3 id="xiv-places-to-set-things-down">xiv) places to set things down</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I’m a strong believer in having a designated place at the entrance for placing house keys upon entry.
(Also, see <em>(c) cultivate meaning in objects and places</em>.)
And I recently noticed that there’s a similar satisfaction in having places throughout the house for settings things down.
A surface next to each seat for setting down a drink.
A convenient place to put items that you use regularly like spatulas, toothbrushes, towels, bathrobes, kitchen trays, and so on.
A loading deck of sorts at the bottom and top of staircases, where one can set down things than need to be brought up or down at a nonurgent time.
A common case for this kind of inbetween surface is to set down glasses, mugs, and other bits that need to be brought to the kitchen.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>A key aspect of these places is that they are convenient (see <em>(a) avoid causes of mental clutter &amp; friction</em>).
It shouldn’t be necessary, for example, to activate your core to pick up or set down when sitting anywhere in the living room.
There should be a spot right there, within reach from a natural sitting position.</p></div>

<hr>

<div class="paragraph"><p>After writing the above, I revisited the book.
Thanks to its relative obscurity, the ebook version was available to borrow immediately from the library.
I’m pleased to find out the authors encourage readers to come up with their own pattern languages.
It occurs to me that some of the my patterns might have some tacit principles in common.
I want to deduce them and make them explicit so I can reference them from relevant patterns and thereby uncover principles that underpin my whole pattern language.</p></div>

<h3 id="a-avoid-causes-of-mental-clutter--friction">a) avoid causes of mental clutter &amp; friction</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I’m trying to articulate the common principle, assuming there is one, between my preference for <em>(i)</em> a sole duvet and for <em>(ii) a walk-in shower</em>.
In the same way I resent having to think about stepping into a bathtub and about where I step while I shower, I resent having to keep track of a top sheet while in bed.
I much prefer to interact exclusively with the duvet.
I am aware that it sounds contrived or even slightly insane, but these things cause me minor mental friction that I wish I could eliminate in totality.
I love to relax my mind, and it’s hard to do so when distracted by little frills and imperfections.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I think there are many little bits in my patterns that can be traced to my intolerance for mental friction.
My distaste for <em>(xiii)</em> having to unlock doors on my way out of my home or having to wait an indeterminate amount of time for an elevator.
My preference for <em>(xii)</em> big mug handles, so I don’t have worry about holding the mug a certain way to avoid burning my knuckles.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Nowadays it’s easy for me to take for granted the convenience of bluetooth headphones, but, years ago, wired headphones caused me constant psychological chafe.
It irked me to have to supervise that pesky dangling cord and it momentarily ruined my calm when it got yanked out of my ears unexpectedly.
To minimize the probability of it catching on protruding bits, like the jagged knobs of our kitchen cabinets, I used to run the cord up my shirt along my back, out through the neckhole, and into my ears like I was in the secret service.
(This was my variant of the common practice of running headphones under the shirt on the <em>front</em> side, which had the issue that, when not in use, the cord would dangle and swing down in front of you.)
I bought my first pair of cordless headphones in 2018 and they were a revelation.
The freedom was exquisite.</p></div>

<h3 id="b-allow-for-incremental-discovery-and-gradual-changes">b) allow for incremental discovery and gradual changes</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I realized how much I love walk-in showers because my current Seattle apartment has one.
In fact, I love it so much that, when we got a roommate, I requested continued access to the bathroom where it is.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Living in different places and in different arranagements is a great way to learn what you like best and what you can’t do without.
(This is one of the perks of renting, I think.)
I learned, for example, how important it is for my wife Z to have a room to be alone in by sharing with her a one bedroom apartment that had minimal architectural division or sound insulation between bedroom and living room.
We covered the french doors with curtains to create visual separation, but that didn’t do much to muffle sound.
The important fact was not whether she was alone or not, it what whether she <em>felt</em> like she was in a private place to unwind and recharge.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Experimentation is possible also within a single home.
For example, I’ve been able to relocate my various plants within the apartment many times, especially the ones that sit on individual wooden stools, which are easy to move and fit into small spaces.
The same is possible with artwork, especially if you use command strips or some other hanging device that leaves no trace.</p></div>

<h3 id="c-cultivate-meaning-in-objects-and-places">c) cultivate meaning in objects and places</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>A place for keys at the entrance is convenient for arrival and departure, and it effects a pleasant sense of transition.
Arriving, it feels nice to unburden oneself of logistical paraphernalia necessary for navigating the world outside, which accentuates the feeling of returning to a place of convenience, comfort, and familiarity.
Departing, it feels nice to equip oneself before stepping through the doorway into the world.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Ordinary actions like these can have meaning.
This imbuing of meaning into inanimate objects and impersonal surroundings is the part of the process that transforms a house into a home.
A building or even a room becomes a place where one is provided for and secure, where one can rest at ease.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>A home is sprinkled with meaning throughout.
A quiet, comfy place to read and relax.
A welcoming common area to be together.
A room of one’s own, a private space.
All these are ordinary physical spaces that provide precious and intangible nourishment.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>It’s obvious that we should avoid and dispel negative meanings from our home.
Less obvious is the task of preventing neutrality and meaninglessness.
The lack of meaning is more insidious than negative meaning for a few reasons.
Firstly, because its presence is not obvious.
Every bit and every corner without meaning is like a little leak that create together a void of meaning that can be felt but not easily traced to a source.
They silently steal from our home’s potential as a place for rest and renewal.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Negative energy is easier to detect and pinpoint, and its invasiveness is felt more sharply, which spurs us into action.
Meaninglessness, on the other hand, is stultifying.
It confuses and bores us with its lack of specificity and sedates us by promoting numbness and detachment.</p></div>

  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">

    <div class="paragraph"><p>In his book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20821373-the-end-of-absence"><em>The End Of Absence</em></a>, Michael Harris laments the everpresence of digital technology.
<!--more-->
He writes stylishly and gracefully, but he struggles to get a grip on the argument he wants to make.
I feel his yearning for mindfulness and relate to his distrust for apps and devices that leech on our attention for profit, but I balk at his dismay at seeing a toddler attempt to zoom in on the cover of a magazine as if it were an iPad screen.</p></div>

<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>He’ll grow up thinking about the Internet with the same nonchalance that I hold towards my toaster and teakettle.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>This observation’s lack of consequence hints at the lack of clarity in the author’s critique of digital technology.
Most frustrating is his lack of self-awareness when recounting past technology alarmists.
He tells us of Hieronimo Squarciafico, who in the 1400s decried the printing press for making too many books available, and of Socrates before that, who warned that writing was bad for one’s memory.</p></div>

<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>Kids these days, for Socrates, were rotting their brains by abandoning the oral tradition.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Harris seems to recognize these two as cynical luddites, but then refuses to acknowledge them as his forerunners.
Instead, he sidesteps into a discussion about how tools reshape the psychologies of their wielders.
It’s a real shame, because a serious take on the role of digital technology in our lives cannot ignore either its usefulness or its permanence.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>It is clear that this technological revolution like all others cannot be evaded without exit from society and that it will continue to transform us.
The question is: how do we incorporate these new technologies into our lives?
How do we retain their usefulness while minimizing the harm they might do to us?</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>There are signs, earlier in the book, that the author won’t really be trying to sort out this knot and will content himself merely with perusing and picking at it.
He mourns the “end of absence”, but never makes it clear where his concept of “absence” even begins.
His vignettes hint at some possible meanings – time without digital technology, time alone out in nature, time to think.
Is that all?
These goals seem perfectly achievable with a little time management.
Has he tried the Pomodoro Technique?
Why ring the alarm bell when a simple kitchen timer will do?</p></div>

    <div class="paragraph">
<p>Out of boredom have sprung many of my projects and hobbies.
<!--more-->
Over the years, patches of evening downtime have served as fertile ground for budding interests like playing chess, playing guitar, singing, beatmaking, programming, and writing.
A crucial factor here is lack, space for something to grow.
(That, for example, would have been a good point for </p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/end-of-absence">Michael Harris</a><p> to make when discussing the ills of digital distraction).</p>
</div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Writing is one of these projects that erupted out of the seemingly lifeless terrain of boredom.
I would be farther behind in my writing output if I hadn’t been so bored with my first full-time software engineering job.
Instead, I found in writing a channel of expression for my energy and ambition for craftsmanship.
Years later, if I wasn’t stranded in an unfamiliar and uninteresting city while visiting my girlfriend, I wouldn’t have made <a href="https://okjuan.me/">my website</a> or, more importantly, <a href="https://okjuan.me/vbook/">this site</a>.

  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">

    <div class="paragraph"><p>How would you feel if you were so good at a game that the rules were changed to undermine your strategy?
<!--more-->
That’s exactly what happened to the curler <a href="https://omni.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Pat_Ryan_(curler)">Pat Ryan</a> and his team.
As told by the Netflix docuseries <a href="https://omni.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Losers_(TV_series)"><em>Losers</em></a>, Pat Ryan’s innovative strategy was so effective that fans began booing his team for succeeding with it.
Even though they were abiding by all the rules, they were, in the eyes of the fans, ruining the game.
Eventually, a new rule called the <a href="https://omni.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Curling#Free_guard_zone">free guard zone</a> was implemented to make illegal the highly effective but boring strategy Ryan’s team had used to win multiple championships.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I suspect history is full of similar examples.
For example, as told in the book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3621358-inverting-the-pyramid"><em>Inverting the Pyramid: The History of Football Tactics</em></a>, various rules of modern soccer were put in place to prevent certain tactics.
Goalies used to be allowed to use their hands anywhere on the field, a fact which a Sunderland keeper exploited to bounce the ball halfway up the field.
The offside rule used to require attackers to stay in front of or in line with not just two but <em>three</em> defensive players.
In fact, the offside rule used to apply to the whole field, not just the attacking half.
Together, these two archaic rules used to make it very difficult for teams in a defensive position to break out into attack.
These rules too were deemed problematic enough to revise, forever changing the way the game was played.</p></div>

    <div class="paragraph"><p>Can quantifying the attributes of a TV show tell us something about its quality?
<!--more-->
I reckon some of the flaws in <em>House of the Dragon</em> would be reflected in statistics like amount of dialogue per minute and number of decisions made per character.
A non-negligible amount of time is spent on dramatic montages and orchestral music that create a moody atmosphere and remind us of how serious the situation is.
This comes at the cost of time that could be spent on actual situations and actual drama, or at least character development that would contribute to future drama.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>These two elements – dialogue and decision-making – each give us an independent perspective into a character, but their combination is especially powerful because it gives us a third angle: insight into what a character is <em>thinking</em>, including what they are thinking unconsciously.
From this we get what might be the critical ingredient of great story-telling: three-dimensional characters.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>My qualm with shows like <em>House of the Dragon</em> is that their plot feels designed and implemented.
I sense the presence of writers and their attempts to show me what’s happening and persuade me that it makes sense.
I can’t get lost in the fictional world as if it were a real one because I see the pencil marks from when it was sketched out.
My <a href="https://omni.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Suspension_of_disbelief">suspension of disbelief</a> never takes off.
One might say, Well, yeah, all fictional plots are prescribed.
But they’re not, and writers like Stephen King and Cormac McCarthy have </p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/where-ideas-come-from">attested to it</a><p>.</p>
</div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>In great shows like <em>The Sopranos</em>, plot is not implemented, it’s incubated.
The show feels to me like it’s happening spontaneously, developing by itself as a sequence of events, reactions, and actions.
In every episode there is constant dialogue between characters and a steady supply of situations that require characters to make decisions.
And much of the time, these have nothing to do with plot.
Every season has at least one major narrative arc, but the dependence is flipped.
Episodes don’t depend on an overarching plot for their meaning.
Episodes generate the plot.
Characters are agents, not passengers.
I don’t feel like the writers are leading me to the plot’s predetermined destination.
In fact I don’t feel their presence at all.
I feel like I’m </p>

It was the first time I shared my writing with complete strangers and I intend to do it again.
I think it’s a great way to motivate diligence in my thinking and writing and to test my reasoning.

<div class="paragraph"><p>Recently a couple friends and I went on our last paddleboarding session of the summer.
It was a worthy finale.
We paddled up Lake Union to a new brewery perched at the water’s edge to attract aquatic patronage.
There we had drinks and appetizers before paddling back through the darkening dusk, drifting along the halflit houseboats towards Seattle’s twinkling cityscape.
Back at the dock we emptied the boards of air and dove back into the lake a few times to the sound of <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3922aHPz8rdcAWwPCM7qUM?si=0eaf8e9bfbe7483f">my oldest playlist</a> on my bluetooth speaker.

  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">

    <div class="paragraph"><p>Absolutely essential read.
Mind-bending and mind-expanding.
<!--more-->
The essential concept is <em>livewiring</em>, which is Eagleman’s term for brain plasticity.
Our brains change all the time, throughout our lives, hour by hour, minute by minute.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>A fascinating example is sighted people learning braille with blindfolds on: with their sense of sight shut off, their brains reallocate the neural resources that <em>would’ve</em> been used for their sense of sight to be used by their sense of touch.
(Is this why music sounds so good at night?)
This is also why blind people’s other senses are heightened: those other senses, backed up by more brainpower, are higher resolution.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>In fact, according to Eagleman, the struggle for neural real estate is so contentious that your sense of vision can’t take a night off.
Eagleman theorizes that </p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/interpret-your-dreams">dreams are nightly exercises</a><p> of our visual muscles that exist to strengthen it against invasions from neighboring neural regions.</p>
</div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>It is at the cost of this volatility that we gain our brain’s extraordinary adaptability.
The fact that our mental capabilities are not genetically pre-programmed means that we rely on the world around us to do the programming.
And, as Eagleman illustrates through cases of severely neglected children, there are deadlines for our basic programming.
What we are neglected in early life we may be neglected forever.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Another essential concept is the “potato head” model of the brain: plug in any data source and your brain will make sense of it.
At first, the data is gibberish, but eventually your brain transforms it into a stream of immediate knowledge.
It transforms it into a sense.
(Eagleman explores this topic more in another of his books, <em>Incognito</em>.)
On this basis, Eagleman’s lab develops skin-stimulating devices that aim to give sight to the blind and hearing to the deaf.
And it’s not as far-fetched as you’d think.</p></div>

<h3 id="watching-tv--movies">watching TV &amp; movies</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>While in PEI, I started watching <em>Lost</em>, which is the alltime favorite of one of my friends, and Z started watching <em>Brooklyn 99</em>.
I’m not sure why, but, as I said about reading <em>A Pattern Language</em>, there is something pleasing about starting something new while on a trip away from home.
Change of routine feels right alongside a change of environment.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I started rewatching <em>Mad Men</em>.
This time I much more easily recognize Don Draper’s extreme immaturity.
It hides so well behind his restrained eloquence and impressive jawline.
I also notice that Peter Campbell is offered as a character foil.
He’s unsuave and unhandsome, but similarly insecure and helpless.
He’s deeply envious, unaware that all the potency and respect that Don enjoys does nothing to salve the wounds that disfigure his hopeless self-image.</p></div>

  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">

    <div class="paragraph"><p>I built two new features in the spirit of the <strong>dynamic</strong> attribute of <a id="2023-08-11-virtual-book" class="" href="/vbook/virtual-book">virtual books</a>.
<!--more--></p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Firstly, I added modified dates to all posts and a way to sort them by post date or modified date.
This discourages me from treating posts like static pieces and instead encourages me to edit, rework, and reimagine them.
I didn’t want to be responsible for manually updating the modified date of a post, so I automated it.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>For my first attempt at implementing it, I put together a plugin written in Ruby (mostly written by GitHub Copilot) that found the most recent commit’s date for each post by looking through the Git history.
It worked, but it also slowed down my local build a lot.
I found a much better solution: set up a git pre-commit hook that updates the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">modified_date</code> in a post’s frontmatter when a change is committed to it.
To implement sorting, I had to use JavaScript.
Working on a static website has made me appreciate how much is possible without JavaScript and what isn’t.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>More challenging to implement and more exciting to complete was a feature I’m calling Revisions, which shows past edits of select posts.
This one was even more important to automate.
Manually creating a revision for every new post would be a ponderous task that would deincentivize me from making changes.
Automatically generated revisions, on the other hand, excite me to make changes.
I want to see how posts change over time and how the converge to “final” form.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>So, the main task was to plug into the Jekyll build to generate new pages that represent the difference between every pair of sequential commits in a post’s Git history.
Once I had that, I just had to do some minor coding in HTML and Liquid to add links in a post’s metadata to link to its revisions.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>After I figured out how to get the full Git word diff between two commits (the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git</code> gem’s API apparently doesn’t expose this part of Git’s functionality), most of the trouble had to do with formatting: stripping Git diff metadata, replacing diff markers with markdown formatting, transforming Markdown to HTML, and styling the HTML.
After I finally got it working locally, I pushed it up to GitHub to kick off the build and publish job.
But after the GitHub Actions finished, the site didn’t look any different!</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>It took me a while to figure out why the GitHub Pages build was passing but not generating any revisions.
I figured the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git</code> gem wasn’t being installed since it isn’t in the list of packages supported by GitHub Pages.
It seemed like the plugin wasn’t running at all.
Only after I added print statements to it did I realize that it <em>was</em> running, but only finding a single commit.
Finally, I fixed it by setting the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fetch-depth</code> of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">checkout</code> action to a pseudoinfinite number so that the full Git history would get processed.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I set it up so I can easily enable or disable revisions for a post by setting <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">show_revisions</code> in its frontmatter.
So far, I’ve enabled revisions for <a id="2024-08-30-good-shower" class="" href="/vbook/good-shower">what makes a good shower?</a>, <a id="2021-02-01-think-invisibly" class="" href="/vbook/think-invisibly">how to think invisibly</a>, and <a id="2024-08-12-tell-a-story-3" class="" href="/vbook/tell-a-story-3">how to tell a story #3</a>.</p></div>

<h3 id="interior-design">interior design</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>An odd perk of splitting my time between Seattle and Vancouver has been furnishing and decorating a second apartment, a task for which I have enough gusto to do twice over.
More than twice, actually.
I’ve starting telling friends that I would gladly help them lay out their spaces.
I told one friend in particular, who finds furnishing and decorating stultifying, that when he buys his house, I will invite myself over and personally hang the artwork and mirror that have been leaning against his apartment walls for years.
I routinely watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/nevertoosmall">Never Too Small</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@noahdaniel.studio">Noah Daniel</a> and have been toying with the idea of making TikToks or Instagram reels about my amateur interest in interior design.
I already have the topic for the initial video: how to get cheap artwork that you love.</p></div>

<h3 id="lounging-on-the-balcony">lounging on the balcony</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Among the finest decisions I’ve made recently is buying patio furniture for our balcony.
I bought it secondhand for $420 USD ($575 CAD), delivery included, and within a week have spent many more minutes (in either currency) lounging, reading, writing, and working on it.
I expect to recoup a good deal of the principal when we resell in a year or two.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>By furnishing the balcony we’ve added to our apartment a whole new space to be in.
It’s like a tree house, perched up among a variety of leafy growth.
Beyond the branches, in the evenings, lays the orange pink sunset silhouetting cranes on the port and past them the city skyline.
It reminds me of this bit from Gail Sheehy’s memoir:</p></div>

<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>I had found a rent-stabilized apartment on Fifth Avenue, near the Metropolitan Museum of Art… It had a terrace overlooking Central Park. A small glass cubicle sat on one end of the terrace, where I wrote as if suspended in the sky. I could watch the leaves turn from scarlet to lemony pale and sit snug in a winter storm like being enclosed in a snow globe. It was as close to a writer’s heaven as one could get.</p></div>

  <div class="paragraph"><p>Unheated, the cubicle was also ideally suited to keeping the neurons jumping. In winter I typed in a hoodie, my feet encased in Alaskan mukluks. In spring, the terrace became my first garden. I filled the window boxes with swaying tulips. Tubs held bonsai mimosa trees and dwarf crabapple trees that bore fruit in the fall. It was a magical place to invite friends for drinks and outdoor supper.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>My alcove is more modest, but magical still.
A private little post embedded in the city.
A perfect place to read and write.</p></div>

<h3 id="traveling">traveling</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Z and I went to Tofino with my family for a week to celebrate my mom’s birthday.
We spent time together, ate great meals, surfed on beautiful beaches, hung out at a wonderful airbnb near the heart of town, spent a day in an <a href="https://www.moonjellyspa.ca/">outdoor spa in a private cove</a> lounging in hot tubs filled with seaweed, and even <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/May_2024_solar_storms">saw the Northern Lights</a>.
Z and I want to go back.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>A week later, Z and I went to </p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/nyc-trip">NYC</a><p> to affirm our suspicion that we would like to live there before we have kids.
I have a bad habit of winging trips, but in the month leading up to this one I dedicated good hours to research and planning.
The time spent was well worth it, rendering some of the most memorable experiences of the trip: Comedy Cellar, Village Vanguard, </p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/blue-note">Blue Note</a><p>, Whitney Museum (for free), Tiny Cupboard Comedy Club, Roberta’s, and SEY coffee.
Some of these I booked in advance, and the others I was aware of and pounced on when the opportunity arose.</p>
</div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>We recently also spent a weekend with friends at an airbnb in Lake Cowichan.
The weather was a bit disappointing, but we had a great time hanging out in and around the hot tub.</p></div>

<h3 id="working">working</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I’ve delivered some good results at work recently.
My tasks continue to be interesting and plenty.
However, it looks like my next promotion, which I was expecting in September, won’t happen until December.
I’m disappointed, but when I reflect on it carefully, I notice it’s not that important.
By no means do I <em>need</em> to be promoted.
It’s alluring because it’s a quantifiable and salient achievement.
But it’s not important one.</p></div>

<h3 id="coding">coding</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Spotify again rejected my request for an extended quota.
I emailed them back asking to speak to a real person.
No response.
It looks like it’s going to be difficult to make <a href="https://okjuan.me/muze-radio/">my app</a> available to all Spotify premium users, unfortunately.
That project will sit on the backburner for a while.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>As for my other recent programming project – this site – I have some interesting new ideas.
To encourage myself to </p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/what-2">revise and rework posted pieces</a><p>, I want to re-order posts by their most recently edited date rather than their original publish date.
That way, I could breathe new life into old ideas that I failed to do justice on initial attempt and baptize them again as new pieces.
This aligns with the <strong>dynamic</strong> aspect of my </p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/virtual-book">virtual book</a><p> idea.
A related idea I have for this site is to let (hypothetical) readers see past versions of each post, in the spirit of what I wrote in my essay </p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/virtual-book">The Virtual Book</a><p> last year:</p>
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>What if a memoirist publishes a piece overlaid with their revisions to show the process of expression and expose the artifice of memoir?
…
What if a novelist publishes a first-person novel in real time to make it feel like the character really exists and is experiencing events alongside the reader?
What if the author then goes back and rewrites previous parts of the novel to show the decay of memory and its corruption in the construction of personal narratives?</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>One of my core interests, and one of the core passions behind this site, is the process of writing.
Interfaces that illuminate and accentuate that process intrigue me.</p></div>

Unsettling in a very effective way, like a hyper-pop Black Mirror.
Wonderfully weird and delightfully non-linear.
By now I know I am a sucker for tangential and episodic storytelling.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Dream Scenario</strong>.
Unsettling.
I kept oscillating between sympathy and disgust for the main character, an intended effect, I think.
However, ultimately, it didn’t seem to have a cogent point to make.
Or maybe I missed it.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Challengers</strong>.
Very entertaining.
I loved the toxic triangle between the three main characters: one chooses to be dominated, one needs to dominate, and one dominates himself to preclude others doing it.
The codependence and power dynamics rang true until they fell a bit flat towards the end.</p></div>

I’ve been an outfield player exclusively for years, but I used to play goalie part-time and fill in when needed.
I miss it a bit.
And goalies are always in demand, so it should be an easy way to get more playing time.
Hopefully I’m not overestimating my skills in net.
I think I’ll find out soon.</p></div>

    <div class="paragraph"><p>The standard bathtub-shower design seems like a good idea.
<!--more-->
Two in one.
But <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Design_by_committee">the compromise</a> at the heart of its design prevents it from being a good shower.
The cost of the compromise is hidden in plain sight, difficult to notice due to its ubiquity.
Allow me to shed some light on the ways that the tub compromises the shower.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>We begin with the uncomfortable task of having to <em>climb</em> in, over a literal barrier, without any clothes to soften accidental contact.
Clearing this hurdle is not merely a matter of stepping high and long because on the other side one must balance onefooted on a skinny, slippery ramp with sloping edges.
It’s shockingly inhospitable ground considering its primary aim is to allow a bipedal, softskinned animal to stand barefooted in showering water and contort while applying lubricants that ooze dangerously downwards onto an already slick surface.
But we’re used to this design, so we don’t notice its baffling unfriendliness.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>If freed from the responsibility of doubling as a tub, a shower can focus on being a good shower.
It can be easy to enter and to exit.
Its standing ground, unobliged to accommodate the bare backside, can be tiled or otherwise surfaced with material that gives traction to the bare foot, even when covered in soapy water.
The dimensions can be square and wide enough to allow a person to turn and easily rinse different parts of their body without having to watch their step or feel unreasonably constricted.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Good design, as they say, is invisible.
A good shower demands no effort or conscious attention from its user.
It lets them get clean while </p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/think-invisibly">their mind wanders</a><p>.
To achieve this, it must make it extremely easy to do all the basic things: get in, stand, wash, rinse, and get out.
The tubshower hybrid most of us have at home fails this basic test.</p>

    <blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>Does the brain control you, or are you controlling the brain? I don’t know if I’m in charge of mine.
<!--more--></p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Karl Pilkington sounds foolish, but he’s onto something.
He tells an anecdote about a time when he finished his grocery list and moved on only to be interrupted by a thought that entered his mind suddenly: <em>Apple</em>.</p></div>

<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>That was weird — who reminded me of that?</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>The thought of apple just appeared and Karl doesn’t know how.
It fell like a raindrop into his mind.
This happens to us all the time, but we don’t notice it because we expect it.
We think <em>What’s his name again?</em> and then something inside us slips an answer into our grasp: <em>Mark</em>.
It’s like shaking a tree until fruit falls out.
We don’t give the tree much credit.
But Karl was leaving the orchard when the apple came rolling after him.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>We talk about the subconscious as a mysterious engine that runs the dreams we soon forget after we wake up.
But it’s also there in the day.
It hums along softly in the background, chiming in helpfully when we need to remember someone’s name or what produce to buy.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>But it’s more than our assistant.
It’s our advisor, our consigliere.
It’s the source of our gut feelings.
Great ideas come from interaction with this humble inner partner, this invisible thinker.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Despite being teased by his buddies for his story about the apple, Karl echoed something the French polymath Poincaré wrote in his essay, Mathematical Creation:</p></div>

<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>At the moment when I put my foot on the step the idea came to me, without anything in my former thoughts seeming to have paved the way for it.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Like Karl, Poincaré tells stories of answers coming to him when he was no longer considering the question.
And he welcomes it.
He recognizes his subconscious mind as a vital actor in his work, a shrewd associate that finds a fresh lead while he rests.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Poincaré then concludes something that Karl would’ve been mocked for saying: resting is productive.
Not because it reenergizes you for more work, but because it is work.
Rest releases the invisible thinker to explore and find what you haven’t noticed yet.
You can feel this happening in the shower when novel ideas surface in your mind without prompt.
And though we can’t steer our “ambient thought”, we can <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/top.html">tell it what to think about</a>.
As Don Draper of Mad Men tells his protégé:</p></div>

<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>Peggy, just – think about it. Deeply. Then forget it. And an idea will jump up in your face.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Our train of thought springs into existence already in motion and it speeds between ideas connected by tracks in our mind.
Though we cannot access the underlying web of knowledge directly, we experience the result of its traversal.
And by training and ruminating on new ideas we integrate them into the network.
This is why jazz musicians can fling out new melodies every night.
A chord change played by the backing band illuminates melodic pathways carved into the musician’s mind during training.
At the gig they just get behind their instrument and go for a ride.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>We tap into these networks not only for spontaneous improvisation but also for careful design.
We draw from a well of memories and impressions, questions and conclusions, recreating and appropriating them for new purposes.
A musician composes from real feelings, from their desires and their fears.
A fiction writer sketches a character from the outlines of real people, from the beauties they’ve admired and faults they’ve despised.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>This personal reservoir is where filmmaker David Lynch fishes for the strange and abstract ideas that appear in his work.
In his book Catching the Big Fish: Meditation, Consciousness, and Creativity, Lynch describes his process more as catching ideas than creating them.
He receives ideas from something inside himself, and consults this inner source to develop and implement them.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Lynch isn’t the only prolific artist with a mysterious inner partner.
Novelist Cormac McCarthy is well aware of his own collaborator.
He said:</p></div>

<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>Writing can be like taking dictation.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Like Poincaré and Pilkington, McCarthy has talked about the mysterious experience of receiving answers from the ether:</p></div>

<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>I’d been thinking about [the problem] off and on for a couple of years without making much progress.
Then one morning…as I was emptying [the wastebasket] into the kitchen trash I suddenly knew the answer.
Or I knew that I knew the answer.
It took me a minute or so to put it together.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>McCarthy often talks about the Night Shift, the period when we sleep and the invisible thinker takes over.
Pilkington agrees – from his book The Moaning of Life:</p></div>

<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>I think I’m more intelligent in my dreams than I am when I’m awake… A few months ago I went to bed with a problem, fell asleep thinking about it and when I woke up I had a solution.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>The invisible thinker rules this hidden world where our creativity lives.
It collaborates with us to devise and improvise, and it even thinks for itself.
When relieved from its duty as our advisor, it roams freely, eager to satisfy its own curiosity.
We heighten our creative potential when we deepen understanding with our internal agent.
Especially if we don’t just ask but also listen.</p></div>

<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>Behind your thoughts and feelings, my brother, there stands a mighty ruler, an unknown sage — whose name is self. In your body he dwells; he is your body. There is more reason in your body than in your best wisdom.</p></div>

  <div class="paragraph"><p>Friedrich Nietzsche, <em>Thus Spake Zarathustra</em> (Kauffman translation, 1954, p.146)</p></div>

  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">

    <div class="paragraph"><p>Can quantifying the attributes of a TV show tell us something about its quality?
<!--more-->
I reckon some of the flaws in <em>House of the Dragon</em> would be reflected in statistics like amount of dialogue per minute and number of decisions made per character.
A non-negligible amount of time is spent on dramatic montages and orchestral music that create a moody atmosphere and remind us of how serious the situation is.
This comes at the cost of time that could be spent on actual situations and actual drama, or at least character development that would contribute to future drama.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>These two elements – dialogue and decision-making – each give us an independent perspective into a character, but their combination is especially powerful because it gives us a third angle: insight into what a character is <em>thinking</em>, including what they are thinking unconsciously.
From this we get what might be the critical ingredient of great story-telling: three-dimensional characters.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>My qualm with shows like <em>House of the Dragon</em> is that their plot feels designed and implemented.
I sense the presence of writers and their attempts to show me what’s happening and persuade me that it makes sense.
I can’t get lost in the fictional world as if it were a real one because I see the pencil marks from when it was sketched out.
My <a href="https://omni.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Suspension_of_disbelief">suspension of disbelief</a> never takes off.
One might say, Well, yeah, all fictional plots are prescribed.
But they’re not, and writers like Stephen King and Cormac McCarthy have </p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/where-ideas-come-from">attested to it</a><p>.</p>
</div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>In great shows like <em>The Sopranos</em>, plot is not implemented, it’s incubated.
The show feels to me like it’s happening spontaneously, developing by itself as a sequence of events, reactions, and actions.
In every episode there is constant dialogue between characters and a steady supply of situations that require characters to make decisions.
And much of the time, these have nothing to do with plot.
Every season has at least one major narrative arc, but the dependence is flipped.
Episodes don’t depend on an overarching plot for their meaning.
Episodes generate the plot.
Characters are agents, not passengers.
I don’t feel like the writers are leading me to the plot’s predetermined destination.
In fact I don’t feel their presence at all.
I feel like I’m </p>

<h3 id="whats-next">what’s next?</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>We’re going to Japan for two weeks over Xmas!
I’ve never been and I’m very excited to go.
I intend to spend time researching, planning, and learning about Japan over the next few months.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I expect to be promoted to Senior Software Engineer in December.
I should know by November.
We’ll see.
I’ve been at Microsoft five years now, so I’m neither late nor early.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I’ll be playing a lot of soccer over the next few months.
I hope that’ll naturally help me resume weight loss.
I lost fifteen pounds in the latter half of last year and I’ve maintained since then.
I would still like to lose another twentyfive pounds.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I’ll be watching every Arsenal game that I can.
They are widely recognized as contenders to win the league, even more so than they were a year ago.
It’s exciting and unnerving.
The season is so long.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I’m overhauling Z’s Vancouver apartment.
I changed the pendant light above the dinner table and I’m in the process of swapping the couch.
There are many more things I plan to do.
Replace the coffee table, install bedside wall lamps, hang up the TV, and make space for the practice drumkit Z intends to buy.
I’m motivated by my excitement.
If anything, it’s hard to stop thinking about it.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Sadly, summer is over.
But I also love the fall.
I’m looking forward to the coziness that comes with it.
For me, September is a very nostalgic month.
The sudden turn in weather reminds me of the beginning of the school year, a time I found quietly thrilling, like the opening montage of a new season of a TV show.</p></div>
