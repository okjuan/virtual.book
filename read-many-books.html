    <div class="paragraph"><p>As I walk through cities nowadays I try to look through a <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/The_Death_and_Life_of_Great_American_Cities">Jane Jacobian</a> lens at the diversity of enterprise and use about.
<!--more-->
By <em>use</em>, Jacobs literally means the uses buildings provide: living, working, commerce, diversion, to name some of the main ones.
Nowadays it’s easy to take for granted mixed-use buildings, but they exist because the city planning orthodoxy of today – which Jacobs influenced through her writing and activism – makes space for them.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Mixing of uses is only one of the ingredients that Jacobs argues districts must employ to generate lively and diverse city life.
Another one is short blocks, to allow foot traffic from adjacent streets.
On a recent walk, I noticed how much was packed onto one side of a short city block on one of the lively stretches of East Hastings in East Vancouver.
A gym offering <em>luxury fight goods and apparel</em>, a plant shop, a laundry service business, a kitchen renovation business, a small counterservice cafe offering “Italian street food”, a nail studio, a print shop, a beauty salon, a travel agency, an importer’s office, a Vietnamese restaurant, and a hip diner.
Most of these on the ground level of a three-storey residential building occupying much of the block.
On the corner past the diner a vacant lot recently bulldozed in preparation for a four-storey mixed-use residential building.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>A fifteen minute walk away begins the vibrant stretch of Commercial Drive, one of the liveliest areas of East Vancouver.
Near its north tip, for example, there’s a gallery, a secondhand clothing shop, a shop for local art, and a coworking space, all in the same building and all apparently run by the <a href="https://www.slicevancouver.ca/">same collective</a>, which hosts events including stand up comedy nights and craft workshops in the gallery and coworking space.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Diversity is possible in cities, Jane Jacobs explains, because they bring together people in quantities so great that critical mass can be reached for projects and enterprises that can’t survive in sparser and less diverse communities.
But for diversity to flourish and thrive, cities must create and maintain four key conditions: mixing of use, short blocks, buildings of varying age, and population density.</p></div>

    <blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>Does the brain control you, or are you controlling the brain? I don’t know if I’m in charge of mine.
<!--more--></p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Karl Pilkington sounds foolish, but he’s onto something.
He tells an anecdote about a time when he finished his grocery list and moved on only to be interrupted by a thought that entered his mind suddenly: <em>Apple</em>.</p></div>

<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>That was weird — who reminded me of that?</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>The thought of apple just appeared and Karl doesn’t know how.
It fell like a raindrop into his mind.
This happens to us all the time, but we don’t notice it because we expect it.
We think <em>What’s his name again?</em> and then something inside us slips an answer into our grasp: <em>Mark</em>.
It’s like shaking a tree until fruit falls out.
We don’t give the tree much credit.
But Karl was leaving the orchard when the apple came rolling after him.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>We talk about the subconscious as a mysterious engine that runs the dreams we soon forget after we wake up.
But it’s also there in the day.
It hums along softly in the background, chiming in helpfully when we need to remember someone’s name or what produce to buy.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>But it’s more than our assistant.
It’s our advisor, our consigliere.
It’s the source of our gut feelings.
Great ideas come from interaction with this humble inner partner, this invisible thinker.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Despite being teased by his buddies for his story about the apple, Karl echoed something the French polymath Poincaré wrote in his essay, Mathematical Creation:</p></div>

<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>At the moment when I put my foot on the step the idea came to me, without anything in my former thoughts seeming to have paved the way for it.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Like Karl, Poincaré tells stories of answers coming to him when he was no longer considering the question.
And he welcomes it.
He recognizes his subconscious mind as a vital actor in his work, a shrewd associate that finds a fresh lead while he rests.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Poincaré then concludes something that Karl would’ve been mocked for saying: resting is productive.
Not because it reenergizes you for more work, but because it is work.
Rest releases the invisible thinker to explore and find what you haven’t noticed yet.
You can feel this happening in the shower when novel ideas surface in your mind without prompt.
And though we can’t steer our “ambient thought”, we can <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/top.html">tell it what to think about</a>.
As Don Draper of Mad Men tells his protégé:</p></div>

<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>Peggy, just – think about it. Deeply. Then forget it. And an idea will jump up in your face.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Our train of thought springs into existence already in motion and it speeds between ideas connected by tracks in our mind.
Though we cannot access the underlying web of knowledge directly, we experience the result of its traversal.
And by training and ruminating on new ideas we integrate them into the network.
This is why jazz musicians can fling out new melodies every night.
A chord change played by the backing band illuminates melodic pathways carved into the musician’s mind during training.
At the gig they just get behind their instrument and go for a ride.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>We tap into these networks not only for spontaneous improvisation but also for careful design.
We draw from a well of memories and impressions, questions and conclusions, recreating and appropriating them for new purposes.
A musician composes from real feelings, from their desires and their fears.
A fiction writer sketches a character from the outlines of real people, from the beauties they’ve admired and faults they’ve despised.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>This personal reservoir is where filmmaker David Lynch fishes for the strange and abstract ideas that appear in his work.
In his book Catching the Big Fish: Meditation, Consciousness, and Creativity, Lynch describes his process more as catching ideas than creating them.
He receives ideas from something inside himself, and consults this inner source to develop and implement them.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Lynch isn’t the only prolific artist with a mysterious inner partner.
Novelist Cormac McCarthy is well aware of his own collaborator.
He said:</p></div>

<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>Writing can be like taking dictation.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Like Poincaré and Pilkington, McCarthy has talked about the mysterious experience of receiving answers from the ether:</p></div>

<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>I’d been thinking about [the problem] off and on for a couple of years without making much progress.
Then one morning…as I was emptying [the wastebasket] into the kitchen trash I suddenly knew the answer.
Or I knew that I knew the answer.
It took me a minute or so to put it together.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>McCarthy often talks about the Night Shift, the period when we sleep and the invisible thinker takes over.
Pilkington agrees – from his book The Moaning of Life:</p></div>

<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>I think I’m more intelligent in my dreams than I am when I’m awake… A few months ago I went to bed with a problem, fell asleep thinking about it and when I woke up I had a solution.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>The invisible thinker rules this hidden world where our creativity lives.
It collaborates with us to devise and improvise, and it even thinks for itself.
When relieved from its duty as our advisor, it roams freely, eager to satisfy its own curiosity.
We heighten our creative potential when we deepen understanding with our internal agent.
Especially if we don’t just ask but also listen.</p></div>

<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>Behind your thoughts and feelings, my brother, there stands a mighty ruler, an unknown sage — whose name is self. In your body he dwells; he is your body. There is more reason in your body than in your best wisdom.</p></div>

  <div class="paragraph"><p>Friedrich Nietzsche, <em>Thus Spake Zarathustra</em> (Kauffman translation, 1954, p.146)</p></div>

So much so, I suspect, that it discourages us from starting a new one, in fear of not reaching the end.
After all, who signs up for a marathon that they don’t expect to finish? Even if you ran an impressive 20 miles, you wouldn’t get the exhilaration of crossing the finish line and the satisfaction of officially achieving a commendable, well-defined goal that other people recognize and admire.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>But is reading a book really about reading every single page that someone put between two covers? On principle, I think people would agree reading is about getting exposed to ideas that inform and influence the way we think.
Surely, then, we can be done with a book regardless of whether we read it from beginning to end.
And if we’ve “finished” the book in this way, shouldn’t we walk away satisfied and guilt-free?</p></div>

<h3 id="break-your-new-years-resolution">Break Your New Year’s Resolution</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Setting a goal number of books to read can foster the habit of reading regularly, a habit we all admire and covet.
However, it’s easy to get carried away with trying to make measurable progress at the expense of approaching your actual goal.
If you get fixated on officially finishing a book, you might be forgetting why you wanted to read it in the first place.
By ditching a book when you feel you’ve had enough of it, you’re staying true to the real reason you set that goal of reading some special number of books by Christmas time.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>In <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/41181911">Super Thinking: The Big Book of Mental Models</a> by Gabriel Weinberg and Lauren McCann, the authors tell a <a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/hanoi-rat-massacre-1902">true story</a> about a government that offered civilians bounty for killing rats in an effort to mitigate the local rat infestation.
Specifically, they offered people money for each rat tail they brought in.
They figured they could reliably track progress on the pest problem without having to handle the corpses.
The plan backfired completely.
Crafty entrepreneurs realized that they could capture a rat, cut off its tail, and then release it, so that it would live on to reproduce: more rats, more tails, more money.
The pest problem worsened significantly.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>But why all the gossip about rodents and dishonest bounty hunters? Well, Weinberg and McCann’s point is that metrics can be counterproductive.
In the case of reading books, if you worry too much about how many books you’ve read front-to-back, you stray from your objective of learning and growing.
Maybe you should change your metric or add a new one: the number of books checked out of the library, or the number of books you read for at least one hour.
Anything that helps you make real progress and not counting rat tails.</p></div>

<h3 id="avoid-the-sunk-cost-fallacy">Avoid the Sunk-Cost Fallacy</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Books aren’t perfect.
Many of them are good.
Many others are just okay.
Sometimes, you benefit by leaving a book unfinished and moving on to another instead of persevering through to the end, regardless of how far you’ve made it.
In that case, by quitting the book, you’re overriding a psychological flaw and making a more rational choice.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>The <strong>sunk-cost fallacy</strong>, as defined in <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11468377-thinking-fast-and-slow">Thinking, Fast &amp; Slow</a> by Daniel Kahneman is:</p></div>
<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>The decision to invest additional resources in a losing account, when better investments are available.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>We fall prey to this error when we stick stubbornly with a book just because of the time we’ve already sunk into it.
If this book is no longer doing it for you, move on.
There are millions of other books and many of them are better than this one.
If you can cut your losses and push through the unpleasantness that comes with doing so, you’ve likely made the optimal choice.</p></div>

<h3 id="read-other-books">Read Other Books</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>If you feel guilty about not finishing a book you’re currently reading, you probably won’t start a new book.
And so, if the book you’re reading loses your interest, you’ll end up losing steam and maybe reading no book at all.
Unless it is important to you to finish this specific book, why not move on and keep your momentum going? By leaving a book unfinished and feeling good about it, you allow yourself to start a new book with excitement instead of guilt.</p></div>

<h3 id="youre-not-absorbing-much-anymore">You’re Not Absorbing Much Anymore</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>We’ve all finished reading a paragraph only to realize that we didn’t absorb much of the information at all.
It can happen when we’re having trouble focusing, but it can also happen when you’ve lost interest.
That’s okay.
It might be time to move on.
Life is long, you can come back to this book in some weeks, months, or even years if it’s a book you think is worth reading eventually.
By moving on, you are valuing results above all else.</p></div>

<h3 id="sacrifice-depth-for-breadth">Sacrifice Depth for Breadth</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>If you learn to ditch books with confidence, you’ll cover more variety of material.
I think this is true not only because you start the next book sooner, but also because you avoid the reading slump you’ll inevitably hit when you’ve committed to a book that you have no interest in reading.
By moving on to another book, you’re covering more ground when it isn’t worth staying put and drilling down for more.</p></div>

<h3 id="its-not-worth-your-time">It’s Not Worth Your Time</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>You might benefit a lot from a book early on, but less so in later chapters.
Perhaps you’ve effectively satisfied your curiosity, or maybe the book’s value is distributed unevenly across its sections.
Regardless, you’re facing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diminishing_returns">diminishing returns</a> and the book might not be worth your time anymore.
By ditching the book, you’re reacting intelligently to a waning profit.</p></div>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>If we choose to finish a book, let’s make that choice for a good reason, and not because leaving it unfinished feels like failure.
Moreover, let’s relish the opportunity to make the smart, if counterintuitive, choice of bailing on a book when it isn’t worth the time.
If we overcome the mental hurdles that stop us from ditching a book even when we are justified, we’ll be free to read more widely and engage more deeply.</p></div>

It was gratifying and intriguing to find a neuoscientific name for a phenomenon that I and many others have intuited.

<div class="paragraph"><p>Also within walking distance of the airbnb were subway stations for the J, L, A, &amp; C lines, which made it easy to get around Brooklyn and into Manhattan on the two days following.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>The Village Vanguard was well worth visiting.
Not only is it a historic jazz venue, but their minimum purchase is just one drink.
Kurt Rosenwinkel and his band were great.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Especially compared with the noisiness and grittiness of Bushwick, Fort Greene and Park Slope’s tree-lined streets and brownstones were stunning.
The affluence of this part of Brooklyn is obvious.

<div class="paragraph"><p>Astoria is not stunning to look at, but certainly more handsome than Bushwick.
It is also, apparently, one of the most diverse neighborhoods in the world, with a particularly strong Greek presence.
English comprised only a modest share of the languages we overheard people speaking in the area.
This excerpt, from Jan Morris’s splendid ode to the wild vibrancy of <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/462198.Destinations">Manhattan (1979)</a>, rang true:</p></div>
<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>Manhattan long ago abandoned its melting-pot function. Nobody even tries to Americanize the Lebanese or the Lithuanians now, and indeed the ethnic enclaves of the island seem to me to become more potently ethnic each time I visit the place.</p></div>

Shopping in SoHo, on the other hand, impressed me.
The Highline was as pretty and as busy as I remember it.

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The ferry was great.
Cheap, easy, and quiet.
The views were great and various.
In FiDi I was shocked at the quantity of tourists.
We only went there because it was the ferry’s terminus, but it was interesting to see it after reading Jane Jacobs’s critique of it in </p>

</div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>The Lower East Side was charming, and it was memorable to eat outside on Bond Street, but the food was pricey.
<em>Wicked</em>, the Broadway show, was as good as I remember it being when I saw it fifteen years ago.
At night we explored Astoria some more, but still did not feel inspired by it.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Revisited INFINITEA and sat again at the table on the sidewalk, looking out on to the street.
It was a delightful way to start the day, and I repeated again for the next two days.
I’m glad I went to the MoMA while Z &amp; Coco went to the Met.
I love walking around museums alone, listening to my music.
This time it occurred to me to leave after a couple hours, have a meal, a coffee, and come back.
I think I’ll be adding that to my museum routine.
Several restaurants in the area give a discount if you show them your MoMA ticket.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Compared to the Village Vanguard, the </p>

Afterwards, walking through Greenwich Village at night, I felt like I was in an amusement park – the heat, the neon signs, people in every direction walking and talking, going into and out of venues, bars and restaurants spilling out onto sidewalk patios.
We got cocktails and then slices to go.
It was a quiet thrill.</p>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Our last day was unexpectedly memorable.
We walked up through Ditmars Steinway and took Citi Bikes to Astoria Park and rode them along the water.
We liked it so much that we looped around and did it again before heading back for our bags to go to the airport.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I found Ditmars Steinway charming enough that I wondered if we might look for apartments there if we ever move to New York.
It seems to strike a great balance between peacefulness and liveliness.
I’m sure many New Yorkers would scoff or snort if I suggested it is an accessible location, but in its center is the Astoria-Ditmars Blvd station, from which runs the N through Astoria, into and all the way down Manhattan, into Brooklyn and all the way through to Coney Island.
Bushwick, however, is not on that path, and would be painful to reach.
Looking at the subway map, it’s clear the routes were designed primarily for commute in and out of Manhattan.</p></div>

    </div></div><p>, I finally cracked open my copy of <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/462198.Destinations"><em>Destinations</em></a> to read Jan Morris’s lovely piece about Manhattan.
Also, I resumed Gloria Steinem’s <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/335090.Revolution_from_Within"><em>Revolution From Within</em></a>, since I’ve been thinking a lot about self-esteem and ego.
Steinem’s reference to Alice Miller’s <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4887.The_Drama_of_the_Gifted_Child"><em>The Drama of the Gifted Child</em></a> sent me on a reading tangent about Miller’s initial advocacy for Konrad Stettbacher’s version of <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Primal_therapy">primal therapy</a> and her eventual <a href="https://www.primals.org/articles/amiller.html">denouncement</a>.
Out of curiosity, I searched for New Yorker articles mentioning Alice Miller and ended up reading <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/04/23/drawn-from-life">this New Yorker article</a> about Bechdel, whom I only knew in relation to the <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Bechdel_test">Bechdel test</a>.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I also started reading <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51409.remembered_rapture"><em>remembered rapture</em></a>, bell hooks’s essays on writing, which is a topic I think about constantly.
This in turn led me to Zora Neale Hurston’s <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37415.Their_Eyes_Were_Watching_God"><em>Their Eyes Were Watching God</em></a>, which bell hooks cites as one of the literary treasures recovered from obscurity by second wave feminism.

  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">

    <div class="paragraph"><p>Starting a new book is exciting.
<!--more-->
It’s like putting on a brand new pair of shoes on a sunny morning, with no puddles in sight.
Sadly, the novelty wears off.
Then, there’s that uncomfortable feeling at the prospect of leaving the book unfinished.
The same book that starts as an exciting little activity becomes a nagging reminder that you failed to reach a goal.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Nobody likes starting a book and failing to finish it.
So much so, I suspect, that it discourages us from starting a new one, in fear of not reaching the end.
After all, who signs up for a marathon that they don’t expect to finish? Even if you ran an impressive 20 miles, you wouldn’t get the exhilaration of crossing the finish line and the satisfaction of officially achieving a commendable, well-defined goal that other people recognize and admire.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>But is reading a book really about reading every single page that someone put between two covers? On principle, I think people would agree reading is about getting exposed to ideas that inform and influence the way we think.
Surely, then, we can be done with a book regardless of whether we read it from beginning to end.
And if we’ve “finished” the book in this way, shouldn’t we walk away satisfied and guilt-free?</p></div>

<h3 id="break-your-new-years-resolution">Break Your New Year’s Resolution</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Setting a goal number of books to read can foster the habit of reading regularly, a habit we all admire and covet.
However, it’s easy to get carried away with trying to make measurable progress at the expense of approaching your actual goal.
If you get fixated on officially finishing a book, you might be forgetting why you wanted to read it in the first place.
By ditching a book when you feel you’ve had enough of it, you’re staying true to the real reason you set that goal of reading some special number of books by Christmas time.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>In <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/41181911">Super Thinking: The Big Book of Mental Models</a> by Gabriel Weinberg and Lauren McCann, the authors tell a <a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/hanoi-rat-massacre-1902">true story</a> about a government that offered civilians bounty for killing rats in an effort to mitigate the local rat infestation.
Specifically, they offered people money for each rat tail they brought in.
They figured they could reliably track progress on the pest problem without having to handle the corpses.
The plan backfired completely.
Crafty entrepreneurs realized that they could capture a rat, cut off its tail, and then release it, so that it would live on to reproduce: more rats, more tails, more money.
The pest problem worsened significantly.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>But why all the gossip about rodents and dishonest bounty hunters? Well, Weinberg and McCann’s point is that metrics can be counterproductive.
In the case of reading books, if you worry too much about how many books you’ve read front-to-back, you stray from your objective of learning and growing.
Maybe you should change your metric or add a new one: the number of books checked out of the library, or the number of books you read for at least one hour.
Anything that helps you make real progress and not counting rat tails.</p></div>

<h3 id="avoid-the-sunk-cost-fallacy">Avoid the Sunk-Cost Fallacy</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Books aren’t perfect.
Many of them are good.
Many others are just okay.
Sometimes, you benefit by leaving a book unfinished and moving on to another instead of persevering through to the end, regardless of how far you’ve made it.
In that case, by quitting the book, you’re overriding a psychological flaw and making a more rational choice.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>The <strong>sunk-cost fallacy</strong>, as defined in <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11468377-thinking-fast-and-slow">Thinking, Fast &amp; Slow</a> by Daniel Kahneman is:</p></div>
<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>The decision to invest additional resources in a losing account, when better investments are available.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>We fall prey to this error when we stick stubbornly with a book just because of the time we’ve already sunk into it.
If this book is no longer doing it for you, move on.
There are millions of other books and many of them are better than this one.
If you can cut your losses and push through the unpleasantness that comes with doing so, you’ve likely made the optimal choice.</p></div>

<h3 id="read-other-books">Read Other Books</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>If you feel guilty about not finishing a book you’re currently reading, you probably won’t start a new book.
And so, if the book you’re reading loses your interest, you’ll end up losing steam and maybe reading no book at all.
Unless it is important to you to finish this specific book, why not move on and keep your momentum going? By leaving a book unfinished and feeling good about it, you allow yourself to start a new book with excitement instead of guilt.</p></div>

<h3 id="youre-not-absorbing-much-anymore">You’re Not Absorbing Much Anymore</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>We’ve all finished reading a paragraph only to realize that we didn’t absorb much of the information at all.
It can happen when we’re having trouble focusing, but it can also happen when you’ve lost interest.
That’s okay.
It might be time to move on.
Life is long, you can come back to this book in some weeks, months, or even years if it’s a book you think is worth reading eventually.
By moving on, you are valuing results above all else.</p></div>

<h3 id="sacrifice-depth-for-breadth">Sacrifice Depth for Breadth</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>If you learn to ditch books with confidence, you’ll cover more variety of material.
I think this is true not only because you start the next book sooner, but also because you avoid the reading slump you’ll inevitably hit when you’ve committed to a book that you have no interest in reading.
By moving on to another book, you’re covering more ground when it isn’t worth staying put and drilling down for more.</p></div>

<h3 id="its-not-worth-your-time">It’s Not Worth Your Time</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>You might benefit a lot from a book early on, but less so in later chapters.
Perhaps you’ve effectively satisfied your curiosity, or maybe the book’s value is distributed unevenly across its sections.
Regardless, you’re facing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diminishing_returns">diminishing returns</a> and the book might not be worth your time anymore.
By ditching the book, you’re reacting intelligently to a waning profit.</p></div>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>If we choose to finish a book, let’s make that choice for a good reason, and not because leaving it unfinished feels like failure.
Moreover, let’s relish the opportunity to make the smart, if counterintuitive, choice of bailing on a book when it isn’t worth the time.
If we overcome the mental hurdles that stop us from ditching a book even when we are justified, we’ll be free to read more widely and engage more deeply.</p></div>
