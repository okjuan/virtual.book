There are many different ways to sum up a year.
Here are some.

### my 2024 in music

In 2024, for the seventh year in a row, I kept a journal playlist, to which I added throughout the year songs that I listened to repeatedly.
It's fun to let time pass and then listen back to these lists.
Music is like aroma, an instantly nostalgic medium.

### my 2024 in books

The first song in my 2024 playlist is by Mark Lanegan, whose memoir {% vbook_post _Sing Backwards and Weep_ | 2023-12-23-sing-backwards-and-weep %} was the first book I finished in 2024.
Books offer an incredible way to access worlds that we will never see in the flesh.
As other great [memoirs]({{site.baseurl}}/tags/memoir) like {% vbook_post _Educated_ | 2020-04-26-educated %} have done for me, Lanegan's installed in my psyche a bank of artificial memories and secondhand experiences that enrich my understanding of the world and even inform my own life decisions.
The written word is a {% vbook_post tremendously efficient medium | 2023-03-09-justify-writing %} for conjuring these pseudoexperiences.
And to think I can absorb it as audio while I perform menial tasks like driving on the highway or cooking lunch!

Books are of course also an incredible way to encounter new ideas.
In {% vbook_post _The End of Absence_ | 2024-08-11-end-of-absence %} I encountered Michael Harris's thoughtprovoking but ultimately underwhelming ideas regarding the intersecting topics of technology and attention.
Later in the year I picked up Matthew B. Crawford's {% vbook_post _The World Beyond Your Head_ | 2024-12-07-world-beyond-your-head %} after seeing Tom MacWright's [glowing review](https://macwright.com/2024/07/07/world-beyond-your-head) of it and with this book I was not disappointed.
As I said in my most recent {% vbook_post /now | 2025-01-11-now %} update, Crawford's book provoked in me a lot of reflection about what things consume my attention and how {% vbook_post environ| 2024-12-15-ecologies-of-attention %}{% vbook_post ments | 2024-12-15-ecologies-of-attention %} dictate that.

### my 2024 as journaled on this site

I posted four entries in 2024:
- {% vbook_post what I'm doing now #3 | 2024-02-19-now %}, posted on February 19th
- {% vbook_post what I'm doing now #4 | 2024-04-23-now %}, posted on April 23rd
- {% vbook_post what I'm doing now #5 | 2024-07-07-now %}, posted on July 7th
- {% vbook_post what I'm doing now #6 | 2024-09-30-now %}, posted on September 30th

I tried to post more often but it was difficult to do so considering the level of detail I put in each one.
