    <div class="paragraph"><p>Starting a new book is exciting.
<!--more-->
It’s like putting on a brand new pair of shoes on a sunny morning, with no puddles in sight.
Sadly, the novelty wears off.
Then, there’s that uncomfortable feeling at the prospect of leaving the book unfinished.
The same book that starts as an exciting little activity becomes a nagging reminder that you failed to reach a goal.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Nobody likes starting a book and failing to finish it.
So much so, I suspect, that it discourages us from starting a new one, in fear of not reaching the end.
After all, who signs up for a marathon that they don’t expect to finish? Even if you ran an impressive 20 miles, you wouldn’t get the exhilaration of crossing the finish line and the satisfaction of officially achieving a commendable, well-defined goal that other people recognize and admire.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>But is reading a book really about reading every single page that someone put between two covers? On principle, I think people would agree reading is about getting exposed to ideas that inform and influence the way we think.
Surely, then, we can be done with a book regardless of whether we read it from beginning to end.
And if we’ve “finished” the book in this way, shouldn’t we walk away satisfied and guilt-free?</p></div>

<h3 id="break-your-new-years-resolution">Break Your New Year’s Resolution</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Setting a goal number of books to read can foster the habit of reading regularly, a habit we all admire and covet.
However, it’s easy to get carried away with trying to make measurable progress at the expense of approaching your actual goal.
If you get fixated on officially finishing a book, you might be forgetting why you wanted to read it in the first place.
By ditching a book when you feel you’ve had enough of it, you’re staying true to the real reason you set that goal of reading some special number of books by Christmas time.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>In <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/41181911">Super Thinking: The Big Book of Mental Models</a> by Gabriel Weinberg and Lauren McCann, the authors tell a <a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/hanoi-rat-massacre-1902">true story</a> about a government that offered civilians bounty for killing rats in an effort to mitigate the local rat infestation.
Specifically, they offered people money for each rat tail they brought in.
They figured they could reliably track progress on the pest problem without having to handle the corpses.
The plan backfired completely.
Crafty entrepreneurs realized that they could capture a rat, cut off its tail, and then release it, so that it would live on to reproduce: more rats, more tails, more money.
The pest problem worsened significantly.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>But why all the gossip about rodents and dishonest bounty hunters? Well, Weinberg and McCann’s point is that metrics can be counterproductive.
In the case of reading books, if you worry too much about how many books you’ve read front-to-back, you stray from your objective of learning and growing.
Maybe you should change your metric or add a new one: the number of books checked out of the library, or the number of books you read for at least one hour.
Anything that helps you make real progress and not counting rat tails.</p></div>

<h3 id="avoid-the-sunk-cost-fallacy">Avoid the Sunk-Cost Fallacy</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Books aren’t perfect.
Many of them are good.
Many others are just okay.
Sometimes, you benefit by leaving a book unfinished and moving on to another instead of persevering through to the end, regardless of how far you’ve made it.
In that case, by quitting the book, you’re overriding a psychological flaw and making a more rational choice.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>The <strong>sunk-cost fallacy</strong>, as defined in <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11468377-thinking-fast-and-slow">Thinking, Fast &amp; Slow</a> by Daniel Kahneman is:</p></div>
<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>The decision to invest additional resources in a losing account, when better investments are available.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>We fall prey to this error when we stick stubbornly with a book just because of the time we’ve already sunk into it.
If this book is no longer doing it for you, move on.
There are millions of other books and many of them are better than this one.
If you can cut your losses and push through the unpleasantness that comes with doing so, you’ve likely made the optimal choice.</p></div>

<h3 id="read-other-books">Read Other Books</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>If you feel guilty about not finishing a book you’re currently reading, you probably won’t start a new book.
And so, if the book you’re reading loses your interest, you’ll end up losing steam and maybe reading no book at all.
Unless it is important to you to finish this specific book, why not move on and keep your momentum going? By leaving a book unfinished and feeling good about it, you allow yourself to start a new book with excitement instead of guilt.</p></div>

<h3 id="youre-not-absorbing-much-anymore">You’re Not Absorbing Much Anymore</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>We’ve all finished reading a paragraph only to realize that we didn’t absorb much of the information at all.
It can happen when we’re having trouble focusing, but it can also happen when you’ve lost interest.
That’s okay.
It might be time to move on.
Life is long, you can come back to this book in some weeks, months, or even years if it’s a book you think is worth reading eventually.
By moving on, you are valuing results above all else.</p></div>

<h3 id="sacrifice-depth-for-breadth">Sacrifice Depth for Breadth</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>If you learn to ditch books with confidence, you’ll cover more variety of material.
I think this is true not only because you start the next book sooner, but also because you avoid the reading slump you’ll inevitably hit when you’ve committed to a book that you have no interest in reading.
By moving on to another book, you’re covering more ground when it isn’t worth staying put and drilling down for more.</p></div>

<h3 id="its-not-worth-your-time">It’s Not Worth Your Time</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>You might benefit a lot from a book early on, but less so in later chapters.
Perhaps you’ve effectively satisfied your curiosity, or maybe the book’s value is distributed unevenly across its sections.
Regardless, you’re facing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diminishing_returns">diminishing returns</a> and the book might not be worth your time anymore.
By ditching the book, you’re reacting intelligently to a waning profit.</p></div>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>If we choose to finish a book, let’s make that choice for a good reason, and not because leaving it unfinished feels like failure.
Moreover, let’s relish the opportunity to make the smart, if counterintuitive, choice of bailing on a book when it isn’t worth the time.
If we overcome the mental hurdles that stop us from ditching a book even when we are justified, we’ll be free to read more widely and engage more deeply.</p></div>

  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">

    <div class="paragraph"><p>In his book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20821373-the-end-of-absence"><em>The End Of Absence</em></a>, Michael Harris laments the everpresence of digital technology.
<!--more-->
He writes stylishly and gracefully, but he struggles to get a grip on the argument he wants to make.
I feel his yearning for mindfulness and relate to his distrust for apps and devices that leech on our attention for profit, but I balk at his dismay at seeing a toddler attempt to zoom in on the cover of a magazine as if it were an iPad screen.</p></div>

<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>He’ll grow up thinking about the Internet with the same nonchalance that I hold towards my toaster and teakettle.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>This observation’s lack of consequence hints at the lack of clarity in the author’s critique of digital technology.
Most frustrating is his lack of self-awareness when recounting past technology alarmists.
He tells us of Hieronimo Squarciafico, who in the 1400s decried the printing press for making too many books available, and of Socrates before that, who warned that writing was bad for one’s memory.</p></div>

<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>Kids these days, for Socrates, were rotting their brains by abandoning the oral tradition.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Harris seems to recognize these two as cynical luddites, but then refuses to acknowledge them as his forerunners.
Instead, he sidesteps into a discussion about how tools reshape the psychologies of their wielders.
It’s a real shame, because a serious take on the role of digital technology in our lives cannot ignore either its usefulness or its permanence.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>It is clear that this technological revolution like all others cannot be evaded without exit from society and that it will continue to transform us.
The question is: how do we incorporate these new technologies into our lives?
How do we retain their usefulness while minimizing the harm they might do to us?</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>There are signs, earlier in the book, that the author won’t really be trying to sort out this knot and will content himself merely with perusing and picking at it.
He mourns the “end of absence”, but never makes it clear where his concept of “absence” even begins.
His vignettes hint at some possible meanings – time without digital technology, time alone out in nature, time to think.
Is that all?
These goals seem perfectly achievable with a little time management.
Has he tried the Pomodoro Technique?
Why ring the alarm bell when a simple kitchen timer will do?</p></div>

  <li>Z slept while the rest of us ate at a nearby izakaya (drinks, raw tuna, cheese pancakes, potato croquettes, chicken karaage, etc.)</li>
  <li>chocolate ice cream bar at 7 Eleven on the way back to the hotel</li>
</ul>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Z &amp; I flew with Air Canada.
We upgraded to Premium Economy to avoid being stuck in a couple of middle seats.
It was expensive, but it made our flight much better.
I spent the whole flight reading and writing.
I read the first 150 pages of <em>Normal People</em> and </p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/normal-people">wrote about it</a><p>, pausing only to eat meals.
I couldn’t believe it when it was announced that we were beginning our descent.</p>
</div>

<h4 id="monday-12232024--tokyo-a-day-of-shopping">Monday 12/23/2024 – Tokyo, a day of shopping</h4>

<ul>
  <li>solo coffee nearby while Z &amp; my family ate breakfast at the hotel</li>
  <li>together took train to Shibuya City, then ate at a good conveyor belt sushi restaurant</li>
  <li>solo flat white @ The Roastery by Nozy Coffee on Cat Street</li>
  <li>solo browse MoMA Design Store &amp; other boutiques, bought tea towel from Hay</li>
  <li>solo walk thru Shibuya, fatigued from jetlag, got another coffee</li>
  <li>solo browsed robe store but did not find what I wanted</li>
  <li>with group again, bought hoodie @ Carhartt Work In Progress store</li>
  <li>bought shoes and slides @ Hoka store</li>
  <li>visit Tadao Ando’s public bathroom in Jingū-dōri Park, which was featured in the movie <em>Perfect Days</em>
</li>
  <li>Shibuya crossing! then very spicy ramen at a place with weird vibes</li>
</ul>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I had severe allergies until the early evening.
This happens to me whenever I travel somewhere new.
In 2017 I went to Europe for the first time and I spent the first full day sneezing and oozing.
Same thing this time in Tokyo for the first 24 hours.
Reactine didn’t seem to make a difference, just had to wait it out.</p></div>

<h4 id="tuesday-12242024--tokyo">Tuesday 12/24/2024 – Tokyo</h4>

<ul>
  <li>arrived at Disney Sea @ 12pm</li>
  <li>rode on lots of rides, walked a lot, listened to Disney Xmas carollers</li>
  <li>subpar pizza &amp; pasta in Little Venice</li>
  <li>explored the rest of the park, rode on more rides, fought jetlag</li>
  <li>left @ 9pm, closing time</li>
</ul>

<div class="paragraph"><p>The architecture and spatial planning of the theme park was really impressive.
It seemed like every corner we rounded we encountered another stridebreaking view of the park.
It reminded me of the architectural tactic of constraining the height and width of hallways to reinforce the impact of emerging into a bigger space.
It’s a method that’s been employed by Tadao Ando of Osaka and other famous architects like Frank Lloyd Wright.</p></div>

<h4 id="wednesday-12252024--tokyo">Wednesday 12/25/2024 – Tokyo</h4>

<ul>
  <li>solo walk through the Shimbashi area getting a couple of coffees</li>
  <li>Z &amp; I explored Ebisu on foot, stopping at a puppy store and a pharmacy</li>
  <li>cocktails @ bar EAS MOR, which had great atmosphere</li>
  <li>visited mall briefly, then dinner @ Toki Taruza withe everyone</li>
  <li>7 Eleven for snacks on the way to the hotel</li>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Tokyo station was huge and very busy.
It felt like being in a beehive.
It took me and Z a while to figure out how to pick up our tickets.
One machine gave us an error message but then we tried a machine in a different section and it worked.
Then we circled through the masses, trying to figure out which screen listed our train’s platform.
When we finally found it, we struggled to pass through the gate.
Z put in the two tickets as the ticket machine had instructed but that wasn’t enough.
We had a confusing interaction with a worker there, who we finally understood was saying to scan our IC card after inserting the tickets.
We made it through and with thirty minutes left until departure time, we lined up to buy food and drinks to take onto the train.
It’s good we came an hour early.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>A thunderstorm began while we were in a taxi on the way to the Kanazawa train station.
Flashes of lightning so bright I thought for a moment our driver had run a red light and triggered a super powerful automated stoplight camera.
We tried a coffee shop near the train station but it was closed for New Years, which is the biggest national holiday in Japan.
Train station was full of stores and flooded with white overhead lighting.
Cruel Summer by Taylor Swift playing in the overhead speakers.
We sat in Tully’s Coffee lounge with our bags piled around our ankles.
On the far wall a horribly sappy and nonsensical marketing poem for <em>&amp; Tea</em>.
I felt like I could be in any other manufactured commercial center around the world.
Soulless places like these often have this sort interchangeability, lack of identity.
Being there, it doesn’t feel like you’re in an actual <em>place</em>.
You’re just temporarily detained in a massproduced commercial limbo.</p></div>

It was a dark maze on the bottom floor of a fancy mall where myriad projectors shone moving patterns and images of light on walls, floors, and ceilings.

<div class="paragraph"><p>My intention was to browse Hands and Itoya in Ginza, but I came across the flea market when I stopped for coffee by Ginza station.
There were dozens of stalls selling ceramics, porcelain, kimonos, jackets, bluedyed fabrics, and so on.
The orange tinted glass I bought was only 400 yen, less than three dollars in USD, and I could see it selling for tens times the amount at trendy stores in the USA and Canada.
I’m still sour about going to the East Vancouver “Flea Market” to find they charge an <em>admission fee</em> and sell priced up secondhand and vintagestyled clothing.</p></div>

In my new cotton robe I move slowly around the apartment and touch things lightly as if trying not to wake someone up.
The silence is exquisite.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>It’s strangely soothing to say nothing for a time.
Z and I sometimes practice this in the car without prior agreement.
The longer we go without saying anything, the more peaceful we feel.
I think it is possible outside of regimented meditation to reap some of its benefits by foregoing habitual self-stimulation like chatting and listening to music to make space for felt moments of clarity.
In modern life we routinely cover up the mysteriously powerful sensations our bodies are capable of generating when idle and we therefore miss out on the cathartic experience of allowing those sensations to come to the front of our awareness.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>In retrospect this is something I’ve been learning to do over the last few years.
In 2020 I started going on runs through my neighborhood in Capitol Hill, Seattle and instead of listening to music I listened to the sound of my body striding through the unusually quiet streets of the early Covid pandemic, revelling in the unexpectedly sunny spring of that strange year.
Birds, wind, chatter, and from balconies clapping of hands and ringing of bells to thank the work of medical professionals across the globe.</p></div>

    <div class="paragraph"><p>There is something skeevy and suspicious about how the writer designed Raoul, the white poor guy, and Burnham, the black poor guy, to create so lurid a contrast between them.
<!--more-->
Raoul is so cruel that he is unsympathizable while Burnham is so principled in favor of the safety of our rich white protagonists that by the end he seems more devoted to their safety than his own welfare or that of his family.
The tell that reveals the loaded hand of the writer is the movie’s failure to explore what a real living Burnham would think, feel, and do.
This evasion is reflected in the denial of Burnham’s due place as a protagonist in the story.
The movie guiltily represents him as collateral allowing innocent whites their riches and presents it as a moral tragedy, but refuses to look it in the face.
It poses questions about class disparity and then sidesteps them, invoking us to focus instead on the mortality we all share, as if this transcendence bridges the gap in material resources that makes life viable.
But notice who is rich and innocent, and who martyrs himself tragically but righteously for the morality of it all.
By acknowledging racialized socioeconomic oppression but not engaging with it honestly, this movie functions as a pressure relief valve to ease the moral guilt of neoliberal whites who feel sorry but not remorseful.</p></div>

I would love to live there for a while someday, although I think it unlikely, even though they offer a six month Digital Nomad visa.
Z’s work is not remote and she wants to develop her career, so teaching English or something of the sort is not particularly useful to her.
Regardless, I am sure we will visit again.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="losing-weight">losing weight</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I am twenty pounds lighter than I was a year and a half ago.
I still want to lose another twenty.
I am trying to eat very consciously and exercise everyday.
I feel optimistic.</p></div>

<h3 id="experimenting-with-daily-routines">experimenting with daily routines</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>For the last few days I have woken up early and immediately gone out on a walk with my coffee.
It’s a lovely way to warm up for the day and start by accomplishing my daily task of exercising.
Walking is useful for me given that I am a homebody with a remote computer job and a reliance on soccer for exercise.
After returning from my morning walks I’ve spent some time reading before getting on with my day.
An aspiration I’ve set for myself is to do each of these everyday: exercise, read, write, work, enjoy, socialize, discuss, grow, &amp; plan.
I realize they might sound cheesy, but they are distillations of more specific intentions I have for 2025.</p></div>

<h3 id="working">working</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>In December I received my expected promotion to Senior Software Engineer.
It’s a milestone in my career.
The pay bump was nice if modest for industry standards, but the biggest perk is the deference I am already getting as part of the increase in my responsibilities.
I have strong opinions on how certain things should be done and I feel already a boost in persuasive power generated from my new title.
To summarize, I feel like I have more agency, and I welcome it.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Matthew B. Crawford’s </p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/world-beyond-your-head"><em>The World Beyond Your Head</em></a><p> has provoked in me a lot of reflection about what things consume my attention and how </p>

<p>I recently read </p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/molloy"><em>Molloy</em></a><p> by Samuel Beckett and I intend to continue with the second book in the trilogy.</p>
</div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I also resumed reading and marveling at the prose in <em>Blood Meridian</em>.
I think it appropriate to take my time with what Harold Bloom called  “the major esthetic achievement of any living American writer.”
Of course, McCarthy has since died and his legacy has begun morphing due to recent news of a very inappropriate relationship he had with a teenage girl named Augusta Britt.</p></div>

<h3 id="watching-movies">watching movies</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Last year as soon as the weather started cooling and days darkening early I started watching movies.
In the last few months I’ve watched <em>The Substance</em>, <em>Woman of the Hour</em>, <em>We Live In Time</em>, <em>The Godfather</em> and <em>The Godfather Part 2</em>, <em>The Power of the Dog</em>, <em>Killers of the Flower Moon</em>, <em>Anora</em>, <em>A Real Pain</em>, <em>Perfect Days</em>, <em>Gladiator II</em>, and <em>Punch-Drunk Love</em>.
Reviews and ratings for these are or will be on <a href="https://letterboxd.com/okjuanito/films/reviews/">my letterboxd account</a>.
Tomorrow I’m going to watch <em>The Brutalist</em>.</p></div>

<h3 id="following-arsenal">following Arsenal</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Following the English Premier League is so interesting because the competition is so fierce and sophisticated.
It is so difficult for teams to win.
It is so difficult for fans or pundits to predict what will happen.
New players arrive, old ones fall away, young ones rise into prominence.
It’s a lucrative business but it is also genuine, gripping drama.</p></div>

<hr>

<h3 id="whats-next">what’s next?</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p>The year 2025 is a blank canvas.
We don’t have any specific plans.
Of course, it is predictable in some ways.
But perhaps more so, it is open ended.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I begin the year with several intentions.
Do big things at work.
Get fitter.
Lose twenty pounds.
Have more discussions with friends.
Read copiously.
Keep writing for and developing this site.
Nurture friendships.
Heal and grow.
Enjoy our DINK status.
Ruminate on longterm plans.</p></div>

<hr>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I round the corner of another year with the intention to change my life.
Change it not majorly, but minorly.
I intend to live in the same place, work the same job, drink the same coffee.
But I want to sharpen my focus.
I intend to withhold my attention a bit more and marshall it with more discipline towards things that matter.
That doesn’t mean I will scold myself if I waste time, or spend it on unimportant things.
But I want to try everyday to dedicate <em>more</em> attention to things that matter, to things that will accumulate rather than disappear into the void like jewelry into the drain.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I will continue resisting idealistic aspirations towards abstract virtue, but will try to submit myself to disciplines that I trust will render concrete results.
Spending more time reading.
Waking earlier.
Avoiding cheap distractions that undermine opportunities to spend time meaningfully.
I’m not so interested in deeming time spent scrolling on instagram or passively consuming recommended YouTube videos as immoral.
It is not bad to produce nothing or learn nothing for a few minutes on a random day, but it is costly to let it become a habit.
Costly in time and in opportunity.
I don’t believe I’m particularly special but I do think there is a version of me at eightysomething years old that looks back with some sastifaction at his life’s work.
I want to do something meaningful and I know the steady progress of minutes hours and days can lead to things that irregular bouts of inspiration can imagine but never produce.</p></div>

<p>Learning to pick between </p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/work"><em>productive</em> and <em>absorptive</em></a><p> activities based on my current mood and energy level has helped me notice, for example, when I should try to write instead of reading.
<!--more--></p>

<div class="paragraph"><p>← productive                                                                                                                                 absorptive →</p></div>

<hr>

<div class="paragraph"><p>It occurred to me recently that there are many other dimensions to consider when picking an activity.
An obvious distinction is <em>active</em> vs <em>passive</em> activities.
It is similar to <em>productive</em> vs <em>absorptive</em>, but it’s possible to be absorptive both actively (e.g. reading) and passively (e.g. watching, listening).</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>← active                                                                                                                                               passive →</p></div>

<hr>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Are you in a mood to expend energy or do you need to refuel?
The same answer will have different implications for different people.
For introverted people, having “expensive” capacity at a given moment offers an opportunity to socialize.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>← expensive                                                                                                                               regenerative →</p></div>

<hr>

<div class="paragraph"><p>After determining that you want to watch a movie – a fine choice when one is feeling passive-absorptive-regenerative – you can figure out whether you want to do your passive absorbing alone or with other people.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>← individual                                                                                                                                             social →</p></div>

<hr>

<div class="paragraph"><p>While going through this exercise, you don’t have to pick a point on each spectrum.
I think it’s unlikely you’ll have answers for all.
(Ah yes, I’m feeling productive-active-social-regenerative, that’s the word I was looking for!)
But with every choice, you filter down many possible activities into the ones best suited to your current mood.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Are you in a social-regenerative mood?
Meet with friends to do something that nourishes you.
Or are you feeling social-expensive?
Do something that you’re not easily motivated to do but that your loved ones want to do with you.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I always try to choose activities based on how I’m feeling so I can evade the taxing experience of forcing myself to do something through willpower alone.
But you can’t always wait for the right mood to come.
In life, you have to do some planning, and you can do that better if you learn how your moods and energy levels fluctuate.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Notice which activities are expensive for you.
Make time after those for your regenerative activites.
Whether you’re more introverted or extroverted, take note of how often you need social interaction to keep a healthy balance.
Whether you’re a morning person or a night owl, dedicate your expensive mood to </p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/work-2">meaningful, important work</a><p>.
If producing is important to you, dedicate time to absorbing as well.

<div class="paragraph"><p>Despite all the movies I’ve watched recently, I still have appetite for more.
Lynch’s recent passing is already making some of my friends more interested in watching his films and I intend to take advantage of that fact.</p></div>
