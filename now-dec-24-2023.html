<div class="paragraph"><p>Finally filed Z’s green card papers.
Phew!
Now we wait.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Whereas I was enjoying the fall, I’m not really enjoying the winter.
Winters are so gray here, in the Pacific Northwest.
It’s making Z and I fantasize about living in a place with sunnier winters.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Visiting my mom and sisters in Victoria.
Spending lots of time in my favorite coffee shops – <a href="https://heyhappycoffee.com/">Hey Happy</a>, <a href="https://www.saint-cecilia.ca/">St. Cecilia</a>, <a href="https://discoverycoffee.com/">Discovery Coffee</a>.
We’re not staying for long, so I probably won’t see many of my friends.
Our cousin is with us, visiting from Spain.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Z and I have been socializing with friends and family a lot in the last couple weeks.
Luckily, we both have a need for periodic “alone time”, a term I learned from her.
We support each other in our routine quest for it.
I’ve been realizing that I’m quite introverted.
I think it’s taken me a long time to realize because of how social Mexican culture is.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I think I lost another 4ish pounds, but I’m a bit skeptical of my vintage bathroom scale that I bought at Goodwill a few years ago.
Can my weight really fluctuate 8lbs in 24hrs??
Z googled it and apparently it’s possible.
I confirmed by weighing myself on my mom’s bathroom scale (also vintage) while visiting Victoria.
Apparently it’s true!
I’ve lost ~17lbs since mid-June.
At this rate of 2.8lbs per month, I’ll hit my goal weight by October 2024.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I’ve had fewer chances to play soccer recently.
Looking forward to playing in January.
I went to the physio and got some exercises to address a recurring issue I have with my right hip/groin.
I’m not diligent with the exercises though, never have been.
I find it hard to keep to scheduled or pre-determined activities.</p></div>

<p>The other day I picked a bunch of books from my library and tried to start each of them.

I had </p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/work-2">energy and free time</a><p>.
None stuck.
Until one did.
That’s the one I read.</p>
</div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Instead of forcing order, I let impulse lead.
I have dozens and dozens of unread books sitting on my shelves, but for my next book I often buy a new one.
If I’m currently interested in a particular topic or author, I follow that.
Curiosity and appetite, though they may take you in new directions, make for great fuel.
Working by willpower, on the other hand, drains you.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Unsupervised impulses can lead us down paths not worth pursuing.
I try to guide myself gently onto one of various directions I’ve consciously chosen.
I move in unpredictable bursts but I move freely.
I make progress in uneven quantities but I make progress.</p></div>

    </div></div><p>.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Instead of working on this site, I started a new project: a web app I called <strong>Muze Radio</strong>.
It’s a new and improved version of <a href="https://github.com/okjuan/muze">Muze Player</a>, a web app I made in my last year of university (2018-2019).
The code is <a href="https://github.com/okjuan/muze-radio">here</a> and the beta version of the app is available <a href="https://okjuan.me/muze-radio">here</a>.
I started on the new version on a whim and ended up obsessed for several days.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>As my obsession gives way to a healthier interest, I am very happy to have published a functional version of the app.
Ever since I read <a href="https://awilkinson.medium.com/skateboard-bike-car-6bec841ed96e">this article</a> in 2016, whenever I work on a project, I dutifully remind myself: if you want to build a car, build a skateboard first.
Then a bike.
Then a car.
At the end of each stage of the development process, you should have something that is not only an improvement on the previous version but also useful by itself.
This prevents wasted effort and enables incremental improvement.
If I suddenly stop working on this app and return to it in a year or two, I will find a minimal, functional app.
I could pick up where I left off without having to first fix a bunch of half-implemented features.
If instead I returned to an ambitious but incomplete prototype, I’d be (rightfully) tempted to scrap it and start over instead of trying to salvage it.</p></div>

Both good.

<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/possibilities">another</a><p> book that should be made </p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/virtual-book">virtual</a><p>.</p>
</div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>It consists of three distinct parts: a memoir of King’s life; advice for fiction writers; and a vignette about King’s near-death experience.
(Really, it consists of two different types of writing: memoir and practical advice.)
King claims that he included the memoir to contextualize his fiction, but I don’t buy it.
I suspect he set out to write this book without a coherent vision for it.
In fact, that’s how he usually writes!</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I am glad he wrote all three parts.
And they don’t go terribly together.
But they’d go better with many other things, too, including things written by other people.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>The simplest way to make this book virtual is to publish it digitally as three separate pieces that readers can choose to consume as they see fit.
This is already an improvement.
Aspiring writers could jump directly to the second piece – the one that <em>is</em> actually King’s thoughts “on writing” – and King’s fans could hear about their beloved author’s background and personal life without having to hear his opinions on grammar and diction.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Each of the three pieces could be divided into smaller chunks.
The piece about writing, for example, could be broken down into King’s thoughts on dialogue, his thoughts on grammar, on character depiction, plot design, etc.
The book is already organized into chapters, but they cannot be consumed independently of the book.
If the chapters were designed to exist independently, they could be easily linked to by other works: books, articles, websites, videos, etc.
King’s book would be only one of many pieces that contained his memoirs and his thoughts on writing.</p></div>

      </div>
    </div></div><p>.
Really enjoyed it.
Many of the recent posts on this site reference it.
In his book, King was entertaining and insightful, but he struck me as somewhat narrow-minded in an interview he did with Charlie Rose.
I understand that King was one of many blind to the brilliance of Kubrick’s adaptation of <em>The Shining</em>, but I was put off by King’s unwavering confidence in dismissing the film as a failure.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I got curious about Stephen King’s fiction and started <em>The Green Mile</em>, which is supposed to be one of his best, but I lost interest.
The audiobook’s cheesy narrator didn’t help.
My impression is that King is a capable pop fiction writer, but not a literary standout.
Maybe I’ll give <em>The Stand</em> or <em>The Shining</em> a try later on.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I’ve been loving audiobooks on Spotify.

<p>My </p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/infinite-jest">second attempt</a><p> to review a book while I read it instead of waiting until I finish it.
<!--more--></p>
</div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>This book’s average Goodreads rating is 4.33, which is high.
But 40 ratings (which amount to less than 1% of the total) gave it only one star out of five.
Many of these folks complain that Lanegan portrays himself as an ultimate macho man, beating betas on his way to seducing any woman he pleases.
To me this seems like a crude interpretation of Lanegan’s tone.
I suppose these readers didn’t stick around until the end of chapter seven, where Lanegan gets explicit about his patheticness:</p></div>

<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>My only way to deal with what I deemed an attack (and I might deem anything an attack in those days) was to attack more aggressively in return. The level of hostility in my offensive depended on my level of fear. Fear of being caught, fear of having to tell the truth, fear of being exposed as the lying, cheating fraud I was. But it was the fear of showing my true heart, at times either so full it might burst or so empty I could cry, that hounded me most viciously.</p></div>

  <div class="paragraph"><p>There had been a perpetual war between myself and the costume of persona I’d donned as a youngster and then worn my entire life. Petrified that someone might discover who I really was: merely a child inside the body of an adult. A boy playacting as a man. My lifelong hard-ass exterior and, underneath that, ironclad interior were all an intricately constructed, carefully cultivated, and fiercely guarded sham. I was, in reality, driven by what I’d heard referred to in rehab all those years ago as “a thousand forms of fear.” Sadly, somewhere deep in my soul, I knew that was probably me.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>There are many such cases throughout the rest of the book.
But I think it is obvious from the beginning that the tone is not boastful.</p></div>

<hr>

<div class="paragraph"><p>The book closes with a chapter called <em>Psychic Storms, Epiphany, and Rebirth</em>.
After years and years of using and peddling drugs, Lanegan escapes Seattle for rehab in L.A. with help from Courtney Love, Kurt Cobain’s widow.
He sleeps and vomits through multi-day withdrawal and emerges from the sick haze in clean clothes and cut hair into a brilliant California day.
There, sitting on a lawnchair, he begins to laugh.</p></div>

<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>I marvelled at my incredible good fortune. I smiled and began to laugh. Then laugh maniacally. I had escaped, I had survived. They had failed to destroy me and I had woken up here in paradise. “I’m still here, motherfuckers, you can’t kill me!” I howled hysterically at the sky. Before my sick crowing had even receded, an unwelcome truth lodged itself in my head: Anything that happens next can only be worse than before. That degree of suffering was beyond my imagination.</p></div>

  <div class="paragraph"><p>My manic laughter turned instantly into uncontrollable sobbing. I hadn’t cried in a long time. It felt as though the tears were being ripped from inside whatever I had that passed for a soul. Clawed out from that lifelong aching place. I moaned and gasped, unable to catch my breath. Suddenly, spontaneously, out of a moment of abject despair, I said out loud: “God change me.”</p></div>

  <div class="paragraph"><p>I had never believed in the traditional Christian god or in any supreme being. I had hated sitting through midnight mass, Catholic weddings, Catholic funerals, especially those torturous Wednesday morning masses at the mission I was forced to endure before getting in line for soup and sandwiches. I didn’t know who I was calling out to, but the second I cried out for mercy, I was nailed by some invisible but overwhelming force, as powerful and sudden as a shotgun blast. A surreal, instantaneous sixteen-hits-of-acid epiphany, as though I’d pissed on an incredibly powerful electric fence.</p></div>

  <div class="paragraph"><p>I was knocked from my chair and my life flashed before my eyes. My wasted childhood, my arrogant youth, my anger and obsessions, crime, delusions, self-loathing, paranoia, hopelessness, fury, and the sad junkie downward spiral.
I’d heard that cliche a million times, “My life flashed before my eyes,” but I finally understood what that meant. In that single instant, it had been powerfully, intensely true. The most authentic experience of my entire life in one second, on the lawn of a Los Angeles psychiatric hospital.</p></div>

  <div class="paragraph"><p>Lying there, sobbing in the grass for the for first time ever I stared directly and honestly into the mirror of my life. In an instant, I saw that my entire life’s way of thinking and behaving was the corrupted opposite of what it should be. My morbid thought process was the wrong side of right.</p></div>

  <div class="paragraph"><p>I had grown up believing you took whatever you could from whoever you could, and always looked out for number one, screwing anyone and everyone in the process. From my earliest childhood memories, I had been a thief and flagrant, transparent, non-stop liar and cheat. Music, which I’d loved, which I’d lived for, which I credited with giving me a life, had long ago become just a means to an end: sex, money, drugs, a place to crash, a bargaining chip, a free ride, whatever I could milk from it. I’d been a rank nihilist who lived every day with an obsessive, burning need to pay back twice as hard anybody who fucked me. I spent hours in my mind digging the graves of my enemies, real and imagined.</p></div>

  <div class="paragraph"><p>My extreme, retrograde sickness had cut me open and left me eviscerated. I had asked to be changed and now, in a second, I was changed. Maybe not by anybody else’s god, but by some very real force that intervened in the life of one sad piece of human roadkill the moment it was asked to.
In order to survive, in order to move forward, I would have to change every single fucking sorry thing about myself. I would have to start over again, clean.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I am compelled to think that what Lanegan experienced in a flash, in a sudden deluge, is not divine, but deeply human: empathy.
Empathy for himself from within and without, and by extension empathy for others.</p></div>

    <div class="paragraph"><p>An incredibly entertaining read, full of absurd, shocking, and sometimes unbelievable scenes.
An awesome example of writing as craft.
<!--more-->
The material is varied and funny, the pace never lets off, the dialogue is very engaging, the repetition of certain words throughout the book – rotten, filthy, fear, loathing – really drives home the paranoia and insanity of the two treacherous beasts (I think those two words also appear often) that stumble and pillage their way through Las Vegas.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I didn’t feel that Thompson really tackled the question of whether the American Dream is dead, like many seem to think or assume…
he muses on the hollowness of drug-centred self-actualization and the evil of Nixon’s America, but to me this seemed more like commentary rather than the big claim everyone sees.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I optimistically assume that the awful behaviour of the characters are not condoned.
But it’s hard to be sure because this is supposedly based on true events.</p></div>

  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">

    <div class="paragraph"><p>My first attempt to review a book <em>while</em> I read it instead of waiting until I finish it.
<!--more--></p></div>

<h4 id="year-of-glad">YEAR OF GLAD</h4>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Main character: (new) Hal Incandenza, reading savant and tennis prodigy.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I’d actually listened to this chapter on audiobook years ago.
My friend Jon told me about this book long ago, before I knew of its literary renown (or <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/11/05/how-to-read-infinite-jest">its notoriety</a> as a status symbol for intellect-signalers.)
I remembered it being funny and very absurd.
Indeed it is.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Wallace’s descriptions are inventive.</p></div>
<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>..the air of the room, the bits of dust and sportcoat-lint stirred around by the AC’s vents dancing jaggedly in the slanted plane of windowlight, the air over the table like the sparkling space just above a fresh-poured seltzer.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Another bit stuck in my mind is his description of the conference room being “double-windowed against the November heat.”
It’s late fall in the US, but it’s hot?
This is said in the third sentence of the first chapter, laying down the first brick of mounting absurdity.
Or maybe I just don’t know US climate that well.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>My only problem with this chapter is that it’s hard to keep track of all the characters and names.
I prefer being able to picture the correct number of people.
I don’t think quantity is the problem though, because I am quite content, for example, keeping track of the dozens of characters in <em>The Sopranos</em>.
I am much more comfortable doing it with visuals.</p></div>

<h4 id="year-of-the-depend-adult-undergarment">YEAR OF THE DEPEND ADULT UNDERGARMENT</h4>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Main character: (new) Erdedy, isolated man with marijuana addiction.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I enjoyed this chapter more, I think because it was much easier to follow, but also probably because I read it when I had a lot of mental energy.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>I assume Wallace’s obsessive personality and problems with addiction helped him create this very vivid scene where Erdedy meticulously arranges another “final” binge of marijuana, junk food, action movies, and masturbation.
Wallace uses </p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/narrate-transparently">transparent narration</a><p> and stream-of-consciousness to put us inside Erdedy’s head.
It feels like we have access to the character’s thoughts because they flit between subjects without transition:</p>
</div>
<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>He had not sat down and outright bold-faced lied to her, it had been more of an impression he’d conveyed and nurtured and allowed to gather its own life and force. The insect was now entirely visible. It was on the shelf that held his digital equalizer. What looked like its reemergence might just have been a change in his attention or the two windows’ light or the visual context of his surroundings. The girder protruded from the wall and was a triangle of dull steel with holes for shelves to fit into. The metal shelves that held his audio equipment were painted a dark industrial green and were originally made for holding canned goods. They were designed to be extra kitchen shelves. The insect sat inside its dark shiny case with an immobility that seemed like the gathering of a force, it sat like the hull of a vehicle from which the engine had been for the moment removed. It was dark and had a shiny case and antennae that protruded but did not move. He had to use the bathroom. His last piece of contact from the appropriation artist, with whom he had had intercourse, and who during intercourse had sprayed some sort of perfume up into the air from a mister she held in her left hand as she lay beneath him making a wide variety of sounds and spraying perfume up into the air, so that he felt the cold mist of it settling on his back and shoulders and was chilled and repelled, his last piece of contact after he’d gone into hiding with the marijuana she’d gotten for him had been a card she’d mailed that was a pastiche photo of a doormat of coarse green plastic grass with WELCOME on it and next to it a flattering publicity photo of the appropriation artist from her Back Bay gallery, and between them an unequal sign, which was an equal sign with a diagonal slash across it, and also an obscenity he has assumed was directed at him magisculed in red grease pencil along the bottom, with multiple exclamation points.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>All throughout, ideas branch off in unorganized directions.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>The redundant descriptions – like the insect’s <em>dark, shiny case</em> and the woman <em>spraying perfume up into the air</em> – suggest what the character is focusing on, in his head.
Particular details like these make their corresponding images more vivid not only for the reader, but also for the character whose mind we are seeing them through.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>The excerpt above is only a fragment of a paragraph four pages in length, which follows a paragraph almost five pages in length.
These two uninterrupted streams of thought have the effect of submerging us in Erdedy’s neurotic consciousness as he waits for and obsesses over an expected delivery of marijuana.</p></div>

<h4 id="1-april--year-of-the-tucks-medicated-pad">1 APRIL – YEAR OF THE TUCKS MEDICATED PAD</h4>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Main character: (recurring) Hal Incandenza, reading savant and tennis prodigy.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Another funny and absurd scene featuring Hal.
Confusingly, in this one, he is articulate and witty.
There is reference but no evidence of his being nonverbal.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Following his dad’s instruction, Hal meets with a self-proclaimed “professional conversationalist”, who is obtuse and confrontational and who turns out to be Hal’s dad in poor disguise.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>A slightly annoying aspect of this chapter is that it jumps between seemingly random topics with no apparent point.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Hal’s dad says something about his wife cheating with lots of people.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>For some reason, Hal calls his dad ‘Himself’ and his mom ‘the Moms’.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>In this chatper there is first mention of some topics that come up in later chapters, including a medical attaché and Byzantine erotica.
There’s also mention of Quebec, which, unless I’m hallucinating, is also mentioned once, in a throwaway comment, in the first chapter.</p></div>

<h4 id="9-may--year-of-the-depend-adult-undergarment">9 MAY – YEAR OF THE DEPEND ADULT UNDERGARMENT</h4>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Main character: (recurring) Hal Incandenza, reading savant and tennis prodigy.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Hal packs his tennis bag in the darkness of 6am.
The phone rings and wakes Hal’s brother and roommate, Mario.
A brief, mysterious phone call from Orin (new character).
Hal seems unbothered.</p></div>

<h4 id="year-of-the-depend-adult-undergarment-1">YEAR OF THE DEPEND ADULT UNDERGARMENT</h4>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Main character: (new) medical attaché, special ear-nose-throat consultant to the personal physician of Prince Q—-, the Saudi Minister of Home Entertainment.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Another funny and absurd chapter.
Our anonymous main character’s job is tending to the yeasty sores that regularly break out on Prince Q—-‘s face due to his compulsive consumption of Toblerone.
The doctor earned his post because he’s so skilled in dealing with the condition:</p></div>
<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>A veritable artist, possessed of a deftness nonpareil with cotton swab and evacuation-hypo, the medical attaché is known among the shrinking upper classes of petro-Arab nations as the DeBakey of maxillofacial yeast, his staggering fee-scale as wholly <em>ad valorem</em></p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>His work, however, is so exhausting that every night he follows the same decompression routine – an unsettling variation on the familiar TV dinner routine – that his servant-wife orchestrates.</p></div>
<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>He reclines before the viewer in his special electronic recliner, and his black-veiled, ethnically Arab wife wordlessly attends him, loosening any constrictive clothing, adjusting the room’s lighting, fitting the complexly molded dinner tray over his head so that his shoulders support the tray and allow it to project into space just below his chin, that he may enjoy his hot dinner without having to remove his eyes from whatever entertainment is up and playing.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>This chapter and Erdedy’s earlier chapter are my favorites so far.
(Maybe I enjoy detailed scenes that focus on a single character?)</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>PS – This man must be somehow relevant to Himself’s mention of medical attachés that the Moms supposedly had affairs with?</p></div>

<h4 id="year-of-the-trial-size-dove-bar">YEAR OF THE TRIAL-SIZE DOVE BAR</h4>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Main characters: (new) Wardine and (new) Bruce Green.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>It consists of two, unrelated vignettes of unfortunate people living pitiful lives.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>First vignette –
Wardine is a teenage girl who is being horribly abused by her mother and uncle.
The characters in this vignette are coded as being black and from a poor area.
They talk in really basic pidgin English.
It’s uncomfortable to read.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Second vignette –
Bruce Green is a high school student who manages to attract the attention of a “fatally pretty” classmate, Mildred Bonk.
He gets her pregnant and they drop out of school to live in a housetrailer with their baby and three other people, one of whom keeps “several large snakes in unclean unconvered aquaria.”</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>The most unexpected chapter so far.
Inexplicable by itself.</p></div>

<h4 id="year-of-the-depend-adult-undergarment-2">YEAR OF THE DEPEND ADULT UNDERGARMENT</h4>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Main character: (recurring) Hal Incandenza, reading savant and tennis prodigy.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Hal chats with his older brother Mario.
Even though Hal is younger, the dynamic is palpably reverse.
Mario asks lots of questions and Hal calls Mario Booboo.
Mario asks Hal why he doesn’t believe in God if he is so good at tennis.
Hal says:</p></div>
<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>God seems to have a kind of laid-back management style I’m not crazy about. I’m pretty much anti-death. God looks by all accounts to be pro-death. I’m not seeing how we can get together on this issue.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Mario then asks why the Moms didn’t get sad about Himself’s death.
Hal tries to persuade Mario that she is sad, but Hal doesn’t seem sure of it either.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>The chapter ends with reference to the medical attaché, who is watching an unmarked video that was delivered to him seemingly by mistake.</p></div>

<h4 id="october--year-of-the-depend-adult-undergarment">OCTOBER – YEAR OF THE DEPEND ADULT UNDERGARMENT</h4>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Orin.
Perhaps he lives in the same condo complex as Erdedy?</p></div>
</div>
<a class="u-url" href="/vbook/infinite-jest" hidden></a>
</article>

      </div>
    </div></div><p>.
We’ll see how far I get.
Read up a bit on the cultural lore around this book.
The New Yorker article <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/11/05/how-to-read-infinite-jest">How to Read “Infinite Jest”</a> was one of the highlights.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Continuing with Jane Jacobs’s <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30833.The_Death_and_Life_of_Great_American_Cities">The Death and Life of Great American Cities</a>.
Over two hundred pages in, still great.
She’s not afraid to follow up her criticisms of orthodox city planning with concrete criteria for good city planning.
She values concreteness and reality above almost all other things.
She routinely and smartly derides “abstractions”.
What matters are real people, real places, real events.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Started <em>Bird By Bird</em> by Anne Lamott.
Did not grab me.
I suspect I’d have to push or skip through a bunch of content that I’m already familiar with to get to the new and thought-provoking stuff.

  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">

    <div class="paragraph"><p>This is my second review of this book.
I have to say – it won me over, big time.
<!--more-->
This time I read a physical copy, and it was worth it.
The spacing and formatting of the print gives the book a mysterious aura.
You feel you’re conferring secretly with the author about a strange magic that hides in prose.
He reveals what he’s learned about teasing this elusive substance into the right configurations.
In the same words he explains to you and shows you.
Some books about writing are sterile and tedious, but this book is on the other end of the spectrum.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Some of its advice has lodged into my writing brain:</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Keep the space between sentences as empty as possible…</strong>
<strong>Most sentences need no preamble - nor postlude.</strong></p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Avoid writing your sentence.</strong>
<strong>Play with it in your head.</strong>
<strong>The range of possible sentence structures narrows after every word you put down.</strong></p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Don’t be afraid that you’ll forget a good sentence or a good idea.</strong>
<strong>Trust yourself.</strong>
<strong>If it is important, you’ll remember it.</strong></p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Lots of worthwhile ideas, many of which aim to loosen rigid rules and challenge habits taught in school.
Are transition words and sentences really necessary?
Do you trust your reader so little?
<strong>You can get anywhere from anywhere.</strong>
It also challenges conventional wisdom regarding “inspiration”, “natural” writing, and “flowing” writing.
It gives interesting writing exercises like putting sentences each on their own line to compare structure, length, and rhythm.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I realized on second read that the author asserts in the introduction that this book is not dogma, but a collection of starting points.
Also, my prayers were answered: the book contains a healthy share of sample prose.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Very glad I came across this book.</p></div>

    <div class="paragraph"><p>Half memoir, half advice for aspiring fiction writers.
Both good.
<!--more--></p></div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>I enjoy and mostly trust his </p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/writing-advice">writing advice</a><p>.</p>
</div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is yet </p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/possibilities">another</a><p> book that should be made </p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/virtual-book">virtual</a><p>.</p>
</div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>It consists of three distinct parts: a memoir of King’s life; advice for fiction writers; and a vignette about King’s near-death experience.
(Really, it consists of two different types of writing: memoir and practical advice.)
King claims that he included the memoir to contextualize his fiction, but I don’t buy it.
I suspect he set out to write this book without a coherent vision for it.
In fact, that’s how he usually writes!</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I am glad he wrote all three parts.
And they don’t go terribly together.
But they’d go better with many other things, too, including things written by other people.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>The simplest way to make this book virtual is to publish it digitally as three separate pieces that readers can choose to consume as they see fit.
This is already an improvement.
Aspiring writers could jump directly to the second piece – the one that <em>is</em> actually King’s thoughts “on writing” – and King’s fans could hear about their beloved author’s background and personal life without having to hear his opinions on grammar and diction.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Each of the three pieces could be divided into smaller chunks.
The piece about writing, for example, could be broken down into King’s thoughts on dialogue, his thoughts on grammar, on character depiction, plot design, etc.
The book is already organized into chapters, but they cannot be consumed independently of the book.
If the chapters were designed to exist independently, they could be easily linked to by other works: books, articles, websites, videos, etc.
King’s book would be only one of many pieces that contained his memoirs and his thoughts on writing.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I saw Rick Rubin’s book displayed in a store window for $40 or something like that.
It was a pretty book, but $40, really?
I checked Spotify and sure enough the audiobook is included in Spotify premium.
We should resist the invitation to view books as commodities.
When you feel the impulse to buy a book, ask yourself:
How excited would you be if the cover was ugly or stained or if the book was used but in fair condition?
That is, do you want it for its substance or its aesthetic?</p></div>

<p>Learning to pick between </p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/work"><em>productive</em> and <em>absorptive</em></a><p> activities based on my current mood and energy level has helped me notice, for example, when I should try to write instead of reading.
<!--more--></p>
</div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>← productive                                                                                                                                 absorptive →</p></div>

<hr>

<div class="paragraph"><p>It occurred to me recently that there are many other dimensions to consider when picking an activity.
An obvious distinction is <em>active</em> vs <em>passive</em> activities.
It is similar to <em>productive</em> vs <em>absorptive</em>, but it’s possible to be absorptive both actively (e.g. reading) and passively (e.g. watching, listening).</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>← active                                                                                                                                               passive →</p></div>

<hr>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Are you in a mood to expend energy or do you need to refuel?
The same answer will have different implications for different people.
For introverted people, having “expensive” capacity at a given moment offers an opportunity to socialize.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>← expensive                                                                                                                               regenerative →</p></div>

<hr>

<div class="paragraph"><p>After determining that you want to watch a movie – a fine choice when one is feeling passive-absorptive-regenerative – you can figure out whether you want to do your passive absorbing alone or with other people.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>← individual                                                                                                                                             social →</p></div>

<hr>

<div class="paragraph"><p>While going through this exercise, you don’t have to pick a point on each spectrum.
I think it’s unlikely you’ll have answers for all.
(Ah yes, I’m feeling productive-active-social-regenerative, that’s the word I was looking for!)
But with every choice, you filter down many possible activities into the ones best suited to your current mood.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Are you in a social-regenerative mood?
Meet with friends to do something that nourishes you.
Or are you feeling social-expensive?
Do something that you’re not easily motivated to do but that your loved ones want to do with you.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I always try to choose activities based on how I’m feeling so I can evade the taxing experience of forcing myself to do something through willpower alone.
But you can’t always wait for the right mood to come.
In life, you have to do some planning, and you can do that better if you learn how your moods and energy levels fluctuate.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Notice which activities are expensive for you.
Make time after those for your regenerative activites.
Whether you’re more introverted or extroverted, take note of how often you need social interaction to keep a healthy balance.
Whether you’re a morning person or a night owl, dedicate your expensive mood to </p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/work-2">meaningful, important work</a><p>.
If producing is important to you, dedicate time to absorbing as well.

The job of the writer is to give them a place to grow, and to transcribe them of course…I believe stories are found things, like fossils in the ground…Stories are relics, part of an undiscovered, pre-existing world. The writer’s job is to use [their] tools…to get as much of each one out of the ground intact as possible.</p></div>

    <div class="paragraph">
<p>Here’s an example of coordinated metaphors, something I wish </p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/coordinate-metaphors">other writers</a><p> used more often.
<!--more-->
It’s an excerpt from </p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/work-2">how to work #2</a><p>, my essay about choosing your next activity based on your current energy level:</p>
</div>
<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>Adapting to the ebb and flow of your capacity makes you not only more efficient, but happier. <strong>Your efforts bear more fruit because you know when the moment is ripe, and you learn to savor small victories when nothing bigger is within reach.</strong></p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>In the second sentence, I try to create a single, fluid image in the reader’s mind by coordinating the metaphors <strong>bear more fruit</strong>, <strong>moment is ripe</strong>, <strong>savor small victories</strong>, and <strong>within reach</strong>.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>But, to be fair, I am biased.
I wonder how many other readers enjoy it like I do, and whether any feel tension between the other images in the excerpt.
Does <strong>ebb and flow</strong> in the first sentence clash with the fruit imagery in the second sentence?
To coordinate the metaphors across the two sentences, I could replace <strong>ebb and flow</strong> with something about seasons, for example.
But that might shift the reader’s attention too far from <em>what</em> is said to <em>how</em> it’s said.
The second sentence alone risks this by including <em>too many</em> coordinated metaphors, but stays in bounds by not forcing or contriving them.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>The goal is not to say to the reader, <em>hey, you see how clever I am?</em> but instead to put satisfying images in their head, preferably without them thinking too much about how they got there.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I think <strong>ebb and flow</strong>, as another image from nature, complements the fruit imagery.
This works especially because the third sentence in the paragraph also contains natural images:</p></div>

<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>Adapting to the ebb and flow of your capacity makes you not only more efficient, but happier. Your efforts bear more fruit because you know when the moment is ripe, and you learn to savor small victories when nothing bigger is within reach. <strong>Gone is the guilt of “being lazy” when your energy dips because you know it’s just a phase in a cycle, a valley in a range of peaks.</strong></p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>These images coordinate not only between themselves but also with a key idea of the essay: there is peace in respecting and abiding by rules of nature.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>But, again, I may be at odds with potential readers of </p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/work-2">how to work #2</a><p>.
I suppose the feeling comes also from the literal images of nature I included in the original version I posted <a href="https://okjuan.medium.com/is-this-working-2-4343dc4594eb">on Medium</a>.</p>

    <div class="paragraph"><p>Half memoir, half advice for aspiring fiction writers.
Both good.
<!--more--></p></div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>I enjoy and mostly trust his </p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/writing-advice">writing advice</a><p>.</p>
</div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is yet </p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/possibilities">another</a><p> book that should be made </p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/virtual-book">virtual</a><p>.</p>
</div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>It consists of three distinct parts: a memoir of King’s life; advice for fiction writers; and a vignette about King’s near-death experience.
(Really, it consists of two different types of writing: memoir and practical advice.)
King claims that he included the memoir to contextualize his fiction, but I don’t buy it.
I suspect he set out to write this book without a coherent vision for it.
In fact, that’s how he usually writes!</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I am glad he wrote all three parts.
And they don’t go terribly together.
But they’d go better with many other things, too, including things written by other people.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>The simplest way to make this book virtual is to publish it digitally as three separate pieces that readers can choose to consume as they see fit.
This is already an improvement.
Aspiring writers could jump directly to the second piece – the one that <em>is</em> actually King’s thoughts “on writing” – and King’s fans could hear about their beloved author’s background and personal life without having to hear his opinions on grammar and diction.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Each of the three pieces could be divided into smaller chunks.
The piece about writing, for example, could be broken down into King’s thoughts on dialogue, his thoughts on grammar, on character depiction, plot design, etc.
The book is already organized into chapters, but they cannot be consumed independently of the book.
If the chapters were designed to exist independently, they could be easily linked to by other works: books, articles, websites, videos, etc.
King’s book would be only one of many pieces that contained his memoirs and his thoughts on writing.</p></div>

I love letting my activities overlap like this.
Let what I am reading feed into what I’m writing, what music I’m listening to, what movies and shows I’m watching, and vice versa.</p></div>

<h3 id="tv">TV</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p><em>How To with John Wilson</em>, season three.
Didn’t realize this was the last season until I casually finished watching the last episode.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p><em>The Last of Us</em>, season one.
I loved the ending of the season, although it also broke my heart.
Brave, truthful writing.
(Regarding Joel, at least.
It’s ludicrous that the other characters gave him the opportunity to do what he did, though.)</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p><em>Severance</em> and <em>Westworld</em>, both season one.
Both have really interesting premises, but neither grabs my attention.
The writing in <em>Westworld</em> feels a bit off-the-mark.
And <em>Severance</em> is a bit slow-paced.</p></div>

<h3 id="movies">Movies</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p><em>Poor Things</em>, Yorgos Lanthimos’s new movie.
One of my favorite movies of recent times.

  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">

    <div class="paragraph"><p>One of my favorite movies of recent times.
<!--more-->
Funny, and full of social commentary with feminist overtones.
Great acting from Emma Stone.
Aesthetically glorious – playful cinematography; an incredible, unorthodox score; enthralling costume and set design.
Subtly reminiscent of Wes Anderson in its dryly humorous dialogue, explicit chapter headings, and tableau-like sets.
The movie’s use of expressionism – “art in which the image of reality is distorted in order to make it expressive of the artist’s inner feelings or ideas”, according to <a href="https://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/e/expressionism#:~:text=Expressionism%20refers%20to%20art%20in,artist's%20inner%20feelings%20or%20ideas">this post</a> – is great because it conveys meaning subtly and makes the movie even more visually engaging.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>However, I don’t think this movie is perfect.
For one, the crappy British accents are distracting.
And I think the writing has some flaws.
Like why should Max be in love with Bella, and in a healthy way, apparently?
Also, I think the writing is sometimes a bit too direct or explicit about its message.
Like when the evil lord says that he loves to amass property and Bella is just another piece of his estate.
We didn’t need to be told, we could already sense it from his character and the context.
For me, the story-telling spell breaks momentarily when I feel like the writers are trying to tell me something.
It reminds me that I’m watching a fiction designed by storytellers.
But I’m a bit picky about this.
I had a similar problem with the writing in <a id="2022-08-06-barbarian" class="" href="/vbook/barbarian">Barbarian</a>.</p></div>

    </div></div><p>.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p><em>Promising Young Woman</em>.
Second watch, this time with Z.
She’s right that the movie is disappointing in its treatment of such a serious and important subject.
It pulls every punch.
Instead of rage and vengeance, we see wrist-slapping and finger-wagging.
<em>Poor Things</em> promises much less and delivers much more feminist catharsis.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p><em>Catch Me If You Can</em>.
Turned it off.
I’m realizing Spielberg is not my favorite.
Maybe he’s like the Stephen King of movies.
Several weeks ago I started watching <em>The Fablemans</em> on the plane and it felt a bit ridiculous, had to turn that off, too.</p></div>
