    <div class="paragraph"><p>Half memoir, half advice for aspiring fiction writers.
Both good.
<!--more--></p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I enjoy and mostly trust his <a id="2023-12-09-king-writing-advice" class="" href="/vbook/writing-advice">writing advice</a>.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>This is yet <a id="2021-08-06-possibilities" class="" href="/vbook/possibilities">another</a> book that should be made <a id="2023-08-11-virtual-book" class="" href="/vbook/virtual-book">virtual</a>.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>It consists of three distinct parts: a memoir of King’s life; advice for fiction writers; and a vignette about King’s near-death experience.
(Really, it consists of two different types of writing: memoir and practical advice.)
King claims that he included the memoir to contextualize his fiction, but I don’t buy it.
I suspect he set out to write this book without a coherent vision for it.
In fact, that’s how he usually writes!</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I am glad he wrote all three parts.
And they don’t go terribly together.
But they’d go better with many other things, too, including things written by other people.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>The simplest way to make this book virtual is to publish it digitally as three separate pieces that readers can choose to consume as they see fit.
This is already an improvement.
Aspiring writers could jump directly to the second piece – the one that <em>is</em> actually King’s thoughts “on writing” – and King’s fans could hear about their beloved author’s background and personal life without having to hear his opinions on grammar and diction.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Each of the three pieces could be divided into smaller chunks.
The piece about writing, for example, could be broken down into King’s thoughts on dialogue, his thoughts on grammar, on character depiction, plot design, etc.
The book is already organized into chapters, but they cannot be consumed independently of the book.
If the chapters were designed to exist independently, they could be easily linked to by other works: books, articles, websites, videos, etc.
King’s book would be only one of many pieces that contained his memoirs and his thoughts on writing.</p></div>

    </div></div><p>, Stephen King recounts how he broke through the writer’s block he encountered 500 pages into writing his book <em>The Stand</em>:</p></div>

<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>I started taking long walks…looking at the same old trees and the same old chattering ill-natured jays and squirrels. Boredom can be a very good thing for someone in a creative jam. I spent those walks being bored and thinking about my gigantic boondoggle of a manuscript. For weeks, I got exactly nowhere in my thinking. It all just seemed too hard, too fucking complex. I had run out too many plot lines and they were in danger of becoming snarled… I circled the problem again and again, beat my fists on it, knocked my head against it. And then, one day when I was thinking of  nothing much at all, the answer came to me. It arrived whole and complete, gift-wrapped, you could say, in a single bright flash. I ran home and jotted it down on paper…I was terrified of forgetting.</p></div>

  <div class="paragraph"><p>Does the brain control you, or are you controlling the brain? I don’t know if I’m in charge of mine.
<!--more--></p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Karl Pilkington sounds foolish, but he’s onto something.
He tells an anecdote about a time when he finished his grocery list and moved on only to be interrupted by a thought that entered his mind suddenly: <em>Apple</em>.</p></div>

<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>That was weird — who reminded me of that?</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>The thought of apple just appeared and Karl doesn’t know how.
It fell like a raindrop into his mind.
This happens to us all the time, but we don’t notice it because we expect it.
We think <em>What’s his name again?</em> and then something inside us slips an answer into our grasp: <em>Mark</em>.
It’s like shaking a tree until fruit falls out.
We don’t give the tree much credit.
But Karl was leaving the orchard when the apple came rolling after him.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>We talk about the subconscious as a mysterious engine that runs the dreams we soon forget after we wake up.
But it’s also there in the day.
It hums along softly in the background, chiming in helpfully when we need to remember someone’s name or what produce to buy.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>But it’s more than our assistant.
It’s our advisor, our consigliere.
It’s the source of our gut feelings.
Great ideas come from interaction with this humble inner partner, this invisible thinker.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Despite being teased by his buddies for his story about the apple, Karl echoed something the French polymath Poincaré wrote in his essay, Mathematical Creation:</p></div>

<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>At the moment when I put my foot on the step the idea came to me, without anything in my former thoughts seeming to have paved the way for it.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Like Karl, Poincaré tells stories of answers coming to him when he was no longer considering the question.
And he welcomes it.
He recognizes his subconscious mind as a vital actor in his work, a shrewd associate that finds a fresh lead while he rests.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Poincaré then concludes something that Karl would’ve been mocked for saying: resting is productive.
Not because it reenergizes you for more work, but because it is work.
Rest releases the invisible thinker to explore and find what you haven’t noticed yet.
You can feel this happening in the shower when novel ideas surface in your mind without prompt.
And though we can’t steer our “ambient thought”, we can <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/top.html">tell it what to think about</a>.
As Don Draper of Mad Men tells his protégé:</p></div>

<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>Peggy, just – think about it. Deeply. Then forget it. And an idea will jump up in your face.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Our train of thought springs into existence already in motion and it speeds between ideas connected by tracks in our mind.
Though we cannot access the underlying web of knowledge directly, we experience the result of its traversal.
And by training and ruminating on new ideas we integrate them into the network.
This is why jazz musicians can fling out new melodies every night.
A chord change played by the backing band illuminates melodic pathways carved into the musician’s mind during training.
At the gig they just get behind their instrument and go for a ride.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>We tap into these networks not only for spontaneous improvisation but also for careful design.
We draw from a well of memories and impressions, questions and conclusions, recreating and appropriating them for new purposes.
A musician composes from real feelings, from their desires and their fears.
A fiction writer sketches a character from the outlines of real people, from the beauties they’ve admired and faults they’ve despised.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>This personal reservoir is where filmmaker David Lynch fishes for the strange and abstract ideas that appear in his work.
In his book Catching the Big Fish: Meditation, Consciousness, and Creativity, Lynch describes his process more as catching ideas than creating them.
He receives ideas from something inside himself, and consults this inner source to develop and implement them.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Lynch isn’t the only prolific artist with a mysterious inner partner.
Novelist Cormac McCarthy is well aware of his own collaborator.
He said:</p></div>

<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>Writing can be like taking dictation.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Like Poincaré and Pilkington, McCarthy has talked about the mysterious experience of receiving answers from the ether:</p></div>

<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>I’d been thinking about [the problem] off and on for a couple of years without making much progress.
Then one morning…as I was emptying [the wastebasket] into the kitchen trash I suddenly knew the answer.
Or I knew that I knew the answer.
It took me a minute or so to put it together.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>McCarthy often talks about the Night Shift, the period when we sleep and the invisible thinker takes over.
Pilkington agrees – from his book The Moaning of Life:</p></div>

<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>I think I’m more intelligent in my dreams than I am when I’m awake… A few months ago I went to bed with a problem, fell asleep thinking about it and when I woke up I had a solution.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>The invisible thinker rules this hidden world where our creativity lives.
It collaborates with us to devise and improvise, and it even thinks for itself.
When relieved from its duty as our advisor, it roams freely, eager to satisfy its own curiosity.
We heighten our creative potential when we deepen understanding with our internal agent.
Especially if we don’t just ask but also listen.</p></div>

<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>Behind your thoughts and feelings, my brother, there stands a mighty ruler, an unknown sage — whose name is self. In your body he dwells; he is your body. There is more reason in your body than in your best wisdom.</p></div>

  <div class="paragraph"><p>Friedrich Nietzsche, <em>Thus Spake Zarathustra</em> (Kauffman translation, 1954, p.146)</p></div>
