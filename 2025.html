    <div class="paragraph"><p>I wrote an essay called <a href="https://okjuan.medium.com/the-virtual-book-part-1-782ccd4cc360">The Virtual Book</a> but I never defined the term.
<!--more-->
By virtual book I mean a book unbound by the traditional and physical constraints of printed books.
I say ‘virtual’ because the greatest possibilities I see are in the virtual world of computers.
Ebooks and audiobooks are just the beginning.
The possibilities that excite me challenge not only the physicality of books but also their more subtle attributes.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>A virtual book can be <strong>multimedia</strong>.
It can consist of words, images, video, audio.
There, we got the obvious one out of the way.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>A virtual book can be <strong>readerdriven</strong>.
Instead of forcing readers to follow the author’s thought process, a virtual book can let each reader steer the way.
Wikipedia does this already.
It lets you search the page for keywords, skip to the section you’re interested in, and even escape into a tangential topic, never to return.
This is a natural way to consume Wikipedia because its form <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Affordance">affords</a> it.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Books generally have one start and one ending, but a virtual book can be <strong>nonlinear</strong>.
Wikipedia is again the obvious example.
But letting the reader drive is only one way to create a nonlinear book.
It’s also possible to create multiple entrypoints, or even multiple endings, like <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Black_Mirror:_Bandersnatch">Black Mirror: Bandersnatch</a>.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>A virtual book can be <strong>dynamic</strong>.
It can change after its initial creation.
Printed books, on the other hand, are static snapshots laboriously rendered by a particular author at a particular time.
But what if a theory is debunked?
Or a hypothesis confirmed?
Or a record shattered?
Or, in the case of storytelling, what if a loose end can be tied up neatly?</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>A virtual book can be <strong>nonmonolithic</strong>.
It does not need to be discrete or selfcontained.
It can consist of many interconnected parts that make up the whole but can exist without it.
It can reference other virtual books, borrow bits from them, and lend bits of its own.
For example, if Herbie Hancock’s memoir was a virtual audiobook, it could allow its snippets to be reconstrued into a documentary about jazz.
(If Ken Burns’ Jazz documentary series was also ‘virtualized’, it could have been updated 15 years after its release to include bits of Herbie’s narration.)
In fact, it could provide material for documentaries about many different topics: jazz, funk, hip hop, Miles Davis, Black Nationalism, Nichiren Buddhism, meditation, and crack addictions, to name some of the obvious ones.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>A virtual book can be <strong>responsive</strong>.
What if a reader could expect a book to field spontaneous questions?
ChatGPT is an obvious candidate here, but the possibility is broader.
What if Herbie Hancock returned to his memoir every now and then to answer questions that readers had left behind while reading it?
What if readers could raise flags on issues that factcheckers would then verify or return to the author for amendment?</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>The possibilities are plenty, and they are thrilling.
The difficulty in realizating them is not technological, but legal and political.
Powerful companies – and therefore governments – are hugely incentivized to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Swartz">prevent the free exchange of “intellectual property”</a>.
To make virtual books possible, we need not only the technological power of software, but also its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons">progressive politics</a>.</p></div>
<hr>
      <h6 class="post-note">Dedicated to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz">Aaron Swartz</a>.</h6>

</article>

      </div>
    </div></div><p>” that most intrigues me is their <strong>dynamism</strong>, the fact that they can change over time.
It excites me not because of its practicality, but because of the artistic possibilities it creates.

<p>A modern torchbearer of </p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/tell-a-story">Thompson’s immersion journalism</a><p> is comedian-journalist <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-AQKm7HUNMmxjdS371MSwg">Andrew Callaghan</a>.
<!--more-->
He roams America in his RV interviewing the country’s kookiest characters and recording their antics.
Like Thompson, Callaghan throws himself into the action.
With false innocence, he encourages his subjects to rant and reveal their quirks and delusions.
In <a href="https://youtu.be/6tuYIXi6nTQ">Return to Tallega</a>, Callaghan shows the unhinged debauchery of beer-soaked racing festivals of the American South much like Thompson did with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Kentucky_Derby_Is_Decadent_and_Depraved">The Kentucky Derby is Decadent and Depraved</a>.
Tom Wolfe compared the techniques of literary realism </p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/tell-a-story">to electricity</a><p> in the otherwise mechanical machine of journalism; he might’ve enjoyed seeing Callaghan modernize the practice with literal electricity.</p>
</div>

<iframe style="border-radius:12px; margin-bottom: 15px;" width="100%" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iq71Cb2jEIE?si=19k-GwHRoh0TPF-O" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Ironically, the old writing principle <em>show don’t tell</em> can lead us </p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/tell-a-story-2">beyond words</a><p> as it has <a href="https://pudding.cool/">The Pudding</a>: a digital publication specializing in ‘visual essays’ developed by ‘Journalist-Engineers’ that write both prose and source code to create their articles.
Their piece <a href="https://pudding.cool/2017/03/music-history/"><em>How Music Taste Evolved</em></a>, more app than article, lets the user click through pop music history to hear snippets of songs that topped the charts from 1958 until 2016.
Instead of forcing you to read about the contrast between the swaying, dreamy sound of <a href="https://youtu.be/57tK6aQS_H0">Smoke Gets In Your Eyes</a> and the youthful pep of <a href="https://youtu.be/FCPutYaGFlE">Stagger Lee</a>, it lets you hear it.
And if you’re not interested in pop music from early 1959, then you can leap forward to whatever decade interests you.
The involvement of the reader is literal.</p>
</div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>As refreshing as it is, the piece is far from fulfilling its potential.
The first improvement is obvious: automatically update every day with the newest song at the top the charts.
(The equivalent for printed books, publishing new editions, is pathetic in comparison.) The piece could take its interactivity to the next level by letting you save songs to your music library or dive into specific artists by linking to their Wikipedia articles, which also update with new information and themselves lead to other articles.
Or it could browse the internet on your behalf to find live performances and interesting articles, showing new things every time you visit.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Using technology, we can bring information alive and make our interactions with it more meaningful.
As Michael Scott puts it:</p></div>

<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>You don’t go to the science museum and get handed a pamphlet on electricity…you put your hand on a metal ball and your hair sticks up straight.
And you know science.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>The benefit of combining mediums is clearest in education, where you want to build both analytical and intuitive understanding.
A musician trying to teach music theory should think twice about writing a traditional book.
Alongside their theoretical explanations, they could offer an interface that lets the user add notes to a music staff and hear what they sound like; or listens to the user play their instrument and transcribes it in real time.
A writer passionate about Hemingway’s writing principles and bent on teaching them may feel the urge to write a book; and, although it would educate aspiring writers, it would lack the interactive experience offered by <a href="https://hemingwayapp.com/">Hemingway App</a>, which shows a writer in real time what rules they are breaching.
(To what extent the rules can be codified is a <a href="https://www.litcharts.com/blog/analitics/what-makes-hemingway/">different question</a>.)</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>As one of the architects responsible for the daring design of the Seattle Central Library <a href="https://youtu.be/1x0PA0Rnjho">said</a>:</p></div>

<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>Books are technology; that’s something people forget.
But it’s a form of technology that will have to share its dominance with any other form of truly potent technology or media.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>What if a memoirist publishes a piece overlaid with their revisions to show the process of expression and expose the artifice of memoir?
Or what if an English professor does the same to compare writing styles and the emotions they convey?
What if a novelist publishes a first-person novel in real time to make it feel like the character really exists and is experiencing events alongside the reader?
What if the author then goes back and rewrites previous parts of the novel to show the decay of memory and its corruption in the construction of personal narratives?</p></div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Long before the birth of the digital world, writers like Hunter S. Thompson breached conventional forms to create new experiences for readers.
And writers can continue to experiment within the book-bound format without intervention from outer disciplines.
But they could also work with designers and engineers to create literature’s equivalent to musical technology like synthesizers and drum machines — the tools that Herbie Hancock used to </p>
<a class="hover-link" href="/vbook/reinvent-yourself">reinvent his art</a><p> time and time again.
If we give artists creative technology, we’ll get back experiences we didn’t even know we were missing.</p>

<div class="paragraph"><p>In this journal I intend to do something like the hypothetical memoirist.
Throughout the year, whenever I feel so inclined, I will write here about events that might happen, are happening, or have happened in 2025.
I think it will be interesting to juxtapose my expectations, experiences, and reflections throughout the year.
I hope it will neutralize the bias we typically grant hindsight, which is a privileged perspective but not a consummate one.</p></div>

<h3 id="january">January</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p><em>January 18 2024</em> –
Winter in the PNW has been unusually dry and sunny.
It’s beautiful, and joyful if you don’t stop to think about the disastrous climactic changes it might portend.</p></div>

<h3 id="february">February</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p><em>January 18 2024</em> –
In early February we have a couple plans for gatherings with friends.
We also intend to visit Victoria.
I look forward to it.
I’m realizing I have a positive association with February.
Perhaps because it’s the month when we usually get snow in the PNW and for a couple days our surroundings are awash in white and sunshine.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p><em>February 4 2024</em> –
As foretold the annual snowdump came down in February, this time on the very first evening of the month.
For people like me that rely on outdoor sports like soccer and biking for exercise it’s rather inconvenient but that inconvenience is more than repaid in stunning views of snowcovered mountains looming above the clouds, lit in the early sunset.
Not to mention the ease with which one could drive up one of those mountains for a weekday evening of skiing.
Diligently the neighborhood character that in the spring and summer tends to the garden in the nearby rotunda today scrapes off the snow from a sidewalk path and peppers blue salt into the gash of concrete as if to cauterize it.
I greet him and he responds with a grin <em>Living the dream!</em>
On the roads his mechanized counterpart heaves aside large mounds of snow effortlessly with its front and from its back showers its trail with salt.
I walk ten minutes to one of the sushi restaurants in the area to pick up my lunch.
Too hungry to wait until I get home I pause and stand beneath the awning outside the restaurant and drink my miso soup and watch the neighborhood go on without me on its natural rhythm.</p></div>

<h3 id="march">March</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p><em>February 4 2024</em> –
I have loose plans to watch <em>Mickey 17</em> with friends when it comes out in theaters.
It was written and directed by Bong Joon-Ho, who directed and cowrote the magnificent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasite_(2019_film)"><em>Parasite</em></a>.</p></div>

<h3 id="april">April</h3>

<h3 id="may">May</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p><em>February 4 2024</em> –
May is the month the European soccer season climaxes.
League and cup winners alike are crowned.
Arsenal, the team I support, are still in the running for two major honors: the English Premier League (EPL) and the UEFA Champions League.
Two days ago they defeated the reigning EPL champions by a whopping and unforeseeable 5-1 scoreline.
And yet our biggest competitor this season is not them, but Liverpool, who are six points ahead of us with a game in hand.
In early May, Arsenal will go to northern England and duel them at Anfield, Liverpool’s fortress.
<em>That</em> will probably be Arsenal’s biggest match of the season.
I start to feel a bit queasy thinking about it now, three months ahead.
It’s shocking how thrilling it is even from a thousands of miles away to support a sports team embroiled in genuine competition.</p></div>

<h3 id="june">June</h3>

<h3 id="july">July</h3>

<h3 id="august">August</h3>

<h3 id="september">September</h3>

<h3 id="october">October</h3>

<h3 id="november">November</h3>

<h3 id="december">December</h3>

<div class="paragraph"><p><em>February 4 2024</em> –
In the spirit of living with forethought and premeditation, I suggested to my mom that we begin planning a post-Christmas trip to Mexico or Guatemala, somewhere warm.
In years past I’ve intended to buy flights for the holiday season months in advance but never managed it.
Hopefully this year.</p></div>
