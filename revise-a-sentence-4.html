    <div class="paragraph"><p>I began with this sentence:</p></div>

<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>These opportunities in my early life allowed me to become not only natively proficient in Spanish and English, but also multicultural.
<!--more--></p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>But I felt something was slightly off with “but also multicultural.”
It’s hard to figure out exactly what I didn’t like about it.
Maybe its meaning was too opaque?
Or the proportions of “natively proficient in Spanish and English” compared to “multicultural” were awkwardly lopsided?</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Whatever the reason, I rewrote it as this:</p></div>

<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>Due to these opportunities in my early life, I am natively proficient in Spanish and English, and culturally embedded in multiple contexts.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Immediately, I disliked the “Due to” construction, so I wrote a third version:</p></div>

<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>These opportunities in my early life allowed me to develop native proficiency in Spanish and English and gave me an intuition for multiple cultural contexts.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I prefer the latest version because it connects cause and effect using verbs rather than with logical statement.
Specifically, to express the causal relationship between the “opportunities in my early life” and my consequent skills, the third version uses the verbs “allowed me to develop” rather than the more abstract, logical connecting bits “Due to” and “I am” of the second version. 
The reader <em>sees</em> the relationship directly in the sentence without having to translate it from a logical statement.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I realize this might sound like nitpicky minutiae.
But I think there is an effective difference in <em>immediacy of meaning</em> here.
By writing “Due to X…” a writer signals to the reader that they must remember “X” until its promised role is revealed.
Until that promise is fulfilled, the reader may have to digest bits of information related to “X” and its yet unknown role, all the while maintaining “X” in working memory.
This is an unnecessary chore that writers should avoid putting onto the reader.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>The final problem I tried to fix was the potential buzzwordiness of “an intuition for multiple cultural contexts.”
I think multicultural people would likely grasp what I mean, but it’s not very concrete and could invite cynical dismissal as a non-statement.
I tried this:</p></div>

<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>These opportunities in my early life allowed me to develop native proficiency in Spanish and English and gave me an intuition that allows me to inhabit multiple cultural contexts.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>But was yet unsatisfied.
It sounds like something someone writes about themselves on their resume or LinkedIn profile.
Still too abstract to be trusted as referring to something real.
So I tried to get specific:</p></div>

<blockquote>
  <div class="paragraph"><p>These opportunities in my early life allowed me to develop native proficiency in Spanish and English and gave me an intuition for cultural subtleties that differ across the US, Mexico, and Canada.</p></div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Now we’re getting more concrete.
Part of the solution is simply to name the specific countries I’m referring to.
This avoids suggesting I could fit into any culture in the world, which would dilute the substance of my statement and tempt readers to distrust it altogether.
I think the phrase “cultural subtleties” also helps despite still being somewhat abstract because it is suggestive of specific things that people experience in daily life, like social cues.

  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">

    <div class="paragraph"><p>A virtue of concrete writing is that it causes a distinct mental sensation.
<!--more-->
One writes “rocky hills of green and grey” and bam, the hills appear in the reader’s mind.
It’s effective because it conjures a salient image and draws the reader’s attention to it.
A dependable way to do this is by referring to concrete things, things that exist out in the world where the reader lives their life.
But readers also have an internal life with a terrain of its own.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>This private expanse exists nowhere physically but is nonetheless experienced with intense and distinctive sensations akin to those caused by the concrete world.
Thus, writing in concrete terms is only one way tap into a reader’s sensory experience.
Words don’t need to refer to objects and their physical qualities in order to evoke a sensation in the reader.
There is a variety of effects a writer can have on a reader that we might try to map onto a spectrum from instinctual, to visceral, to intuitive, to rational.
Regardless, physicality is only one variable in the formula.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>The hollowness of buzzwords, for example, is related to their inablility to cause a specific mental effect.
They are duds not because the words themselves are meaningless, but because they seem to refer to nothing in particular.
Words become buzzwords when too many people use them to avoid saying something, when they wield them like a blunt object, swatting away invocations to say something of substance, something concrete.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>This failure on the speaker’s part infects words themselves.
They lack vigor not only when present in the platitudes of dishonest politicians and interested businesspeople, but also when used thoughtfully by people who mean them in a particular way.
My mom for example uses the word “synergy” in a genuine, intentional way, but I am skeptical that her optimism is enough to revitalize the word, which is arguably as lifeless as a carcass, all the meat of its meaning picked away to fodder the keynote speeches of glib business executives.</p></div>
